      "Longest update based on the number of sentences: An America First Economic Plan: Winning The Global Competition Speech Transcript:  Thank you for the invitation to speak to you today.  It's wonderful to be in Detroit. We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America.  It's a conversation about how to Make American Great Again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least.  The City of Detroit Is Where Our Story Begins Detroit was once the economic envy of the world.  The people of Detroit helped power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century. When we were governed by an America First policy, Detroit was booming.  Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the American Dream. But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.  When we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.  The skyscrapers went up in Beijing, and in many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in Detroit.  Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense.  Today, Detroit has a per capita income of under $15,000 dollars, about half of the national average.  40 percent of the city's residents live in poverty, over two-and-half times the national average. The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average. Half of all Detroit residents do not work. Detroit tops the list of Most Dangerous Cities in terms of violent crime – these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent.    In short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent's failed economic agenda.  Every policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.   She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community…and the crime policies that have made you less safe…and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets...and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries… and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity.   She is the candidate of the past.   Ours is the campaign of the future.   This is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results.   Today, I will outline my economic vision.  In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.   Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas.  All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and American production.     If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn't do better than Hillary Clinton's economic agenda.     Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence.   The one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States.  Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.   That's why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.   My campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first.   Here is what an America First economic plan looks like.   First, let's talk tax reform.   Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.   Hillary Clinton – who has spent her career voting for tax increases – plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase.  Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.     Recently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited again – to use a now famous term – when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.   I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs.   The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete.    As part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers.   Tax simplification will be a major feature of the plan.   Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance.   My plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process.  We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent.  For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero.   While we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity.  These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation.     We will Make America Grow Again.   In the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family.  It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.   The State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton's failed leadership.  The Washington Post just published a devastating article on Hillary Clinton's broken promises.  She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator.  But what happened?  The Washington Post writes, and I quote: \"upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent…the former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislation… Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run…data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during Clinton's first term.\"   Compare that to my record.  In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, \"How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,\" the paper writes that I – and this is a direct quote – \"waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out…almost by force of will — [he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.\"   This is what I want to do for our country – I want to jumpstart America.   Now let's look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally.   Their policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and a doubling of the national debt.   There are now 94.3 million Americans outside the labor force.  It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of nearly 14 million people.   The Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans.   Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.   Nearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since President Obama took office.  Another nearly 7 million Americans are living in poverty.   We have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.   58 percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.   1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force.  These are the real unemployment numbers – the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.   Meanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago.   The average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes.  On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent.  The United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent.   It's almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level.   In other words, we punish companies for making products in America – but let them ship products into the U.S. tax-free if they move overseas. This is backwards.  All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States.  Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes.  Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan.  Hillary Clinton's plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business.  I am going to cut regulations massively. Our lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country – and into cities like Detroit.   To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments.  No one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans. My plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes. We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas.  Our plan will bring that cash home, applying a 10 percent tax.  This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan.  Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax.  American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death – it's just plain wrong. We will repeal it. Next comes regulatory reform  As with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want to keep jobs and wealth in America  Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country. The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980.  It is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year – that's money taken straight out of cities like yours. The federal register is now over 80,000 pages long. As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more. In 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations – each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy. It is time to remove the anchor dragging us down.  Upon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations.  My running mate, Mike Pence, signed a similar order when he became governor of Indiana. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses.  I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders. Next, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs.  Those regulations will be eliminated. We are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win.  When I am president, we will.   One of the most important reforms of all is trade reform.   As Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment.  We've seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria.  We've seen it in Iran.  We've seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment. But we've also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here in Detroit Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth.   She supported Bill Clinton's NAFTA, she supported China's entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Let's talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers.    President Obama, and the usual so-called experts who've been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion – resulting in some 70,000 jobs.  Like Hillary Clinton's broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute.  Our exports to South Korea haven't increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion – more than doubling our trade deficit with that country.  The next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Hillary Clinton's closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. Guaranteed.  Her donors will make sure of it. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP – and it's also a vote for NAFTA. Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion.  Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year.  This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole.    According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan.  Today, that number is only 160,000 Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton's apology. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.  Hillary Clinton's Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry.  In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal.  According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs.  Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved.  That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen.  Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests.  Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website.  It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA.  If we don't get a better deal, we will walk away.  At the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China.  This alone could return millions of jobs into our economy.    China is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit.  They break the rules in every way imaginable.  China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property.  They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers. Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs.  According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States. Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.  Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade.  But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers.  Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are.  Also critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform. The Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses.   As a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs. Hillary Clinton says her plan will \"put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.\"     We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work.   Clinton not only embraces President Obama's job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans.   According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.   A Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.   According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will:   • Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years;   • Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades;   • Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years.     The reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning   When we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity.   We can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.     As part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families.  I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts.   Likewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice.   We will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country.  Without security, there can be no prosperity.  We must have law and order.   In the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items.  One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.   We will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide – saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country.   We also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration.  This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.   Detroit – the Motor City – will come roaring back.  We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past.   Our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system.   The other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday – who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.   There will be no change under Hillary Clinton – only four more years of Obama.   But we are going to look boldly into the future.  We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves.   American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas.   American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.   We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation.   It will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy - mined from American sources - that powers this country.  It will be American workers who are hired to do the job.  Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.  Our country will reach amazing new heights.  All we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past.  We can't fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.  We can't solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them.  Only by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results.  We need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America.   Before everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn't be done.   America is ready to prove the doubters wrong.   They want you to think small.  I am asking you to think big.   We are ready to dream great things for our country once again.   We are ready to show the world that America is Back – Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before.   Thank you, and God Bless You.\n",

I said it, it was wrong, and I apologize.  I've travelled the country talking about change for America. But my travels have also changed me.  I've spent time with grieving mothers who've lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I've been humbled by the faith they've placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down. Let's be honest.  We're living in the real world.  This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today.  We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were 8 years ago and Washington is broken. Hillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground.  I've said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims.

Thank you for your amazing support. LETS WIN this November - get out and VOTE!  **REMARKS AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY**  Thank you. It is always so great to be back in New Hampshire, the state where we had our first victory in this incredible journey.  I\\'ve come to know and love the people of New Hampshire. You are strong, independent and you are free.  We are all going to work very hard together over the next 40 days, and we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.  We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.  We are going to create millions of new jobs for our people, trillions in new wealth for our communities, and rising wages for every working American.  We are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.  We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.  Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.  I am an outsider fighting for you.  Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple but very important phrase: Follow The Money.  The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow the money.  The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow the money.  The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow the money.  The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Again, just follow the money.  In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.  She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.  The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.  Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.  Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.  She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale – and if she ever got the chance, she\\'d put the Oval Office up for sale too.  She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. We\\'re going to call them the FBI Immunity 5. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.  She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country.  The American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.  The Clintons are the sordid past.  We are the bright future.  While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.  This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.  Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don\\'t think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she\\'ll do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men \"super-predators.\"  Same thing goes for Hispanic voters – they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.  A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.  My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.  We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and we are going to lower the business rate from 35% to 15% -- making America into a magnet for new jobs.  Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated, along with every illegal executive order.  We will unleash the power of American energy – we are sitting on $50 trillion dollars in untapped energy reserves, and we are going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people.  Common core will be ended, and disadvantaged children will be allowed to attend the school of their choice.  The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.  And the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in New Hampshire, will be renegotiated.  NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton, and supported by Hillary Clinton – and your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since it was approved. You\\'ve lost 1 in 4 since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.  Hillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and, if she gets the chance, she would approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership – which would destroy manufacturing in this state.  Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.  I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.  From now on, it\\'s going to be America First.  Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?  Think about it. For how many years have the American people asked for our tax code to be fixed? Or for our infrastructure to be repaired? Or for the waste to be removed from the budget? For how many years have voters pleaded for secure borders, fair trade deals, and quality schools that serve parents and students?  All the things you\\'ve ever wanted for your country have been denied.  The reason for this is simple. It\\'s because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don\\'t want these changes to happen.  These special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative.  She\\'s been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.  She\\'s there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.  Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors – we\\'re taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.  That includes keeping your family safe.  New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America\\'s large cities, and that it\\'s the largest single-year increase in 45 years.  More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.  The failed politicians and the arrogant media don\\'t want me to talk about the crime and the violence that is happening in our country. They just want me to go along with the status quo.  Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me, and trying to silence all of us.  We will never back down from fighting to save American lives.  That also means keeping our nation safe from Radical Islamic Terrorism. Hillary Clinton can\\'t even say the words.  We are also going to keep our country safe from drugs. New Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across our border. The rate of heroin overdoses has nearly quadrupled – once again, our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people.  I am going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border – that is a promise.  The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.  Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We\\'re trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.  They\\'re all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.  I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.  Together, we can accomplish anything we want.  But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.  You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.  You have 40 days until the election. You have 40 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.  Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away.  You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.  The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.  On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.  Here is just some of the great things that will happen for your country:  We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring back our manufacturing jobs; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2ndamendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.  We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.  American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.  American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.  American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.  We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.  I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.  Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.  It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.  Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.  We Will Make America Wealthy Again.  We Will Make America Strong Again.  We Will Make America Safe Again.  And We Will Make America Great Again.

It\\'s so great to be in Wisconsin tonight.  A recent Reuters poll had us tied in Wisconsin, and we were just in Iowa where we are up by 10 in the Reuters poll – and a new post-debate Google poll has us leading Hillary Clinton by 2 points nationwide, and that\\'s despite the fact that they were suppressing bad news about Hillary Clinton.  On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.  It\\'s going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.  We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.  Hillary Clinton is an insider who fights only for her donors and for herself.  I am an outsider fighting for you.  One of the first things we are going to do is restore law and order to this country. Our good friend, Sheriff Clarke, is here with us tonight.  New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America\\'s large cities, and that it\\'s the largest single-year increase in 45 years.  More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.  Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.  Across the entire nation, for cities of all sizes, small and large, the homicide rates rose by more than 10% last year.  This is a national crisis.  Yet, my opponent, Hillary Clinton, continues to attack the police. First, she calls our supporters – many of them cops, soldiers and firefighters – deplorable and irredeemable.  Then, in our debate this week, she accusses the entire country, including all of law enforcement, of \"implicit bias,\" – essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced.  Maybe Hillary Clinton should confine her comments to herself. After all, she is the one who described young African-American men as \"super-predators.\"  How can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has such a low opinion of its citizens?  How can she lead a country when she thinks America is full of racists, deplorables and irredeemables?  By smearing tens of millions of hardworking, decent Americans she has rendered herself unfit to be President.  She has nothing but hostility in her heart for hardworking Americans, of all backgrounds, who just want to live in safety, security and peace.  The police officers she attacks are the same people – of all colors and nationalities – who race into danger every day to save the lives of complete strangers.  Those fostering the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in this country share directly in the blame for the violence and chaos that threatens our most vulnerable citizens.  My agenda of reducing crime will benefit all Americans, but those who will benefit most are African-American and Hispanic-American citizens living in high crime communities. We are going to save thousands of lives.  The special interests, the arrogant media, and the political insiders, don\\'t want me to talk about the crime that is happening in our country and in our inner cities. They don\\'t want you to know about the hurt and pain that is happening to our fellow citizens. They want me to just go along with the same failed policies that have caused so much needless suffering and so much preventable heartache.  Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me and trying to silence all of us.  I will never back down from fighting to save American lives.  I will never back down from fighting to save America\\'s inner cities.  The only people Hillary Clinton ever fights for are the special interests who write her checks. Follow The Money.  Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don\\'t think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she\\'ll do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does, and that will never change.  Same thing goes for Hispanic voters – they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.  58% of African-American youth don\\'t have jobs. There is another shooting in Chicago every 2 hours. 45% of African-American children under the age of six are living in poverty.  The inner cities have been left behind.  Crime is through the roof, public education is a disaster, there are no jobs, it\\'s dangerous to walk down the street with your child. To the African-American community, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump, I will fix it.  I will fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before.  Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.  The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow The Money.  The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow The Money.  The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow The Money.  The special interests who want open borders, for cheap labor, are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow The Money.  She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country.  In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.  She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.  She and Bill received a total of $150 million in speaking fees from special interests since Bill left office. It\\'s all part of the rigged system being run at your expense.  The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.  Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.  And don\\'t forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton – or all the favors and access granted to those who provided funds. She even gave up 20% of America\\'s uranium supply to Russia.  She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale – and if she ever got the chance, she\\'d put the Oval Office up for sale too.  She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.  The American people have had it with years, decades, of the Clintons\\' scandals and corruption.  This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.  Hillary Clinton is a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.  I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.  From now on, it\\'s going to be America First.  These special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money. She\\'s there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.  Look at her career. She\\'s been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She\\'s failed at everything. She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt. She failed on ISIS – in fact, she unleashed ISIS onto the world.  She failed upstate New York – promising 200,000 jobs, but instead the jobs left. All she did was name a post office and a highway.  She failed the inner cities.  She\\'s failed women and children.  The only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors.  Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors – we\\'re taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.  I\\'m not owned or controlled by anyone – my loyalty is to you, and no one else. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.  My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.  We will cut your taxes, reduce regulations, negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.  We are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child – including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America. We will put every American kid on the ladder of American success: a great education, and a great job.  The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.  Follow the Money.  Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We\\'re trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.  They\\'re all part of the same rigged political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. And they are all in for a big day of reckoning on November 8th.  Government will start working for you again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.  That\\'s what I want to do for our country – I want to go into every neighborhood and unlock their potential for all of our people.  Together, we can accomplish anything we want.  But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th – and it means you need to start voting early. Early voting is already underway.  You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.  You have six weeks until the election. You have six weeks to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.  You have one last magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.  Don\\'t let it slip away. Don\\'t let this chance go. Stand up and be heard – for your family, for your city, for your country.  The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.  This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.  Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:  I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.  We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.  American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.  American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.  American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.

Today, I'm going to outline a plan for American economic revival – it is a bold, ambitious, forward-looking plan to massively increase jobs, wages, incomes and opportunities for the people of our country.  My plan will embrace the truth that people flourish under a minimum government burden, and it will tap into the incredible unrealized potential of our workers and their dreams.  Right now, 92 million Americans are on the sidelines, outside the workforce, and not part of our economy. It's a silent nation of jobless Americans.  Look no further than the city of Flint, where I just visited. The jobs have stripped from this community, and its infrastructure has collapsed. In 1970, there were more than 80,000 people in Flint working for GM – today it is less than 8,000. Now Ford has announced it is moving all small car production to Mexico.  It used to be cars were made in Flint and you couldn't drink the water in Mexico. Now, the cars are made in Mexico and you can't drink the water in Flint.  We are going to turn this around. My economic plan rejects the cynicism that says our labor force will keep declining, that our jobs will keep leaving, and that our economy can never grow as it did once before.  We reject the pessimism that says our standard of living can no longer rise, and that all that's left to do is divide up and redistribute our shrinking resources.  Everything that is broken today can be fixed, and every failure can be turned into a great success. Jobs can stop leaving our country, and start pouring in. Failing schools can become flourishing schools. Crumbling roads and bridges can become gleaming new infrastructure. Inner cities can experience a flood of new jobs and investment. And rising crime can give way to safe and prosperous communities.  All of these things, and so much more, are possible. But to accomplish them, we must replace the present policy of globalism – which has moved so many jobs and so much wealth out of our country – and replace it with a new policy of Americanism.  Under this American System, every policy decision we make must pass a simple test: does it create more jobs and better wages for Americans? If we lower our taxes, remove destructive regulations, unleash the vast treasure of American energy, and negotiate trade deals that put America First, then there is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash.  America will truly be the greatest place in the world to invest, hire, grow and to create new jobs, new technologies, and entire new industries. Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, America will become the world's great magnet for innovation and job creation.  My opponent's plan rejects this optimism. She offers only more taxing, regulating, more spending and more wealth redistribution – a future of slow growth, declining incomes, and dwindling prosperity.  The only people who get rich under Hillary Clinton's scheme are the donors and the special interests. In Hillary Clinton's America, we have surrendered our status as the world's great economy, and we have surrendered our middle class to the whims of foreign countries.  Not one single idea she has will create one net American job, or create one new dollar of American wealth for our workers. The only thing she can ever offer is a welfare check. Our plan will produce paychecks, and they're going to be great paychecks for millions of people now unemployed. In the course of this campaign, I have travelled all across this country and I've met the most amazing people. Every day, I've seen the goodness and character of our country, and brave citizens proudly fighting through hard times and difficult circumstances.  In many parts of our country, the hard times never seem to end. I've visited cities and towns in upstate New York where half the jobs have left and moved to other countries.  Politicians have abandoned these places all over our country and the people who live there. Worse still, politicians have heaped scorn and disdain on these wonderful Americans. My opponent described tens of millions of American citizens as deplorable and irredeemable – how can Hillary Clinton seek to lead this country when she considers its citizens beyond redemption?  The hardworking people she calls deplorable are the most admirable people I know: they are cops and soldiers, teachers and firefighters, young and old, moms and dads, blacks, whites and Latinos – but above everything else, they are all American. They love their families, they love their country, and they want a better future. These are the forgotten men and women of America. People who work hard but don't have a voice.  I am running to be their voice, and to fight to bring prosperity to every part of this country. Too many of our leaders have forgotten that it's their duty to protect the jobs, wages and well-being of American workers before any other consideration.  I'm not running to be President of the world. I'm running to be President of the United States – and as your President, I will fight for every last American job.  We are the nation that tamed the West, dug out the Panama Canal, won two World Wars, and put a man on the moon.  It's time to start thinking big once again. That's why I believe it is time to establish a national goal of reaching 4% economic growth. In working with my economic team, we've put together a plan that puts us on track to achieve that goal. Over the next ten years, our economic team estimates that under our plan the economy will average 3.5% growth and create a total of 25 million new jobs. You can visit our website to see the math.  This growth means that our jobs plan, including our childcare reforms, will be completely paid-for in combination with proposed budget savings. It will be deficit neutral. If we reach 4% growth, it will reduce the deficit.  It will be accomplished through a complete overhaul of our tax, regulatory, energy and trade policies.  Right now, under Obama-Clinton policies, the economy grew only 1.1 percent last quarter – that translates to millions of lost jobs. This is the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression.  Over the last 7 years, the economy grew only 2.1 percent, the slowest period in seventy years. Had the economy grown under Obama at the same rate as Reagan, it would have meant 10 million more jobs.  Perhaps most shockingly, 1 in 6 men aged 18-34 are either in jail or out of work. Meanwhile, another 2 million Hispanic-Americans have been added to the ranks of those in poverty.  On top of it all, the Obama-Clinton policies have doubled the national debt. It took more than 230 years for the United States to accumulate it's first $10 trillion dollars in debt – it took President   Obama only eight years to add another $10 trillion. Now, it would be one thing if that money had been used to completely rebuild our nation, our military, and our infrastructure.  Instead, the opposite happened. We doubled our debt and, in return, we have dilapidated infrastructure, failing schools, a badly depleted military, and another 14 million people who have left the workforce.  Never has so much money been spent so poorly. But we're going to turn that all around. Here's how. It begins with bold new tax reform.  As outlined in Detroit, our tax plan will greatly simplify the code and reduce the number of brackets from 7 to 3. The 3 new brackets will be 12, 25 and 33, but low-income Americans will pay no income tax at all – in fact, our plan will remove millions and millions of workers from the income tax rolls entirely.  By lowering rates, streamlining deductions, and simplifying the process, we will add millions of new jobs.  In addition, because we have strongly capped deductions for the wealthy and closed special interest loopholes, the tax relief will be concentrated on the working and middle class taxpayer. They will receive the biggest benefit – it won't even be close.  This is a working and middle class tax relief proposal. The tax relief for these workers will be expanded by my childcare proposals that I have worked on with my daughter, Ivanka. These proposals are a central element of our comprehensive tax reform and economic growth plan.  Families will be able to fully deduct the average cost of childcare from their taxes, including stay-at-home parents. Because this deduction is capped, it will disproportionately benefit working and middle class families. The less you make, the larger a share of your income you can exclude from taxation.  Parents will also be able to enroll in tax-free dependent care savings accounts for their children or elderly relatives. Low-income households will benefit from both an Expanded Earned Income Tax Credit – in the form a Childcare rebate – and a matching $500 contribution for their savings accounts.  A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill.  A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill. By contrast, someone earning $5 million will receive virtually no change in their tax bill at all.  One of our greatest job creation measures is going to be our 15% business tax rate – down from the current 35% rate, a reduction of more than 40 percent. An explosion of new business and new jobs will be created. It will be amazing to watch. We will also allow U.S.-based manufacturers to fully expense the cost of new plants and equipment.  On top of that, we will bring back trillions in business wealth parked overseas and tax it at a 10% rate. Some people say there are $2 trillion dollars overseas, I think it's $5 trillion. By taxing it at 10% instead of 35%, all of this money will come back into our country.  We will turn America into a magnet for new jobs – and that means jobs in our poorest communities.  Next, comes regulations. One of the keys to unlocking growth is scaling-back years of disastrous regulations unilaterally imposed by our out-of-control bureaucracy.  Regulations have grown into a massive, job-killing industry – and the regulation industry is one business I will put an end to.  In 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Every year, overregulation costs our economy $2 trillion dollars a year and reduces household wealth by almost $15,000 dollars.  I've proposed a moratorium on new federal regulations that are not compelled by Congress or public safety, and I will eliminate all needless and job-killing regulations now on the books. This includes eliminating some of our most intrusive regulations, like the Waters of The U.S. Rule. It also means scrapping the EPA's so-called Clean Power Plan which the government itself estimates will cost $7.2 billion a year. This Obama-Clinton directive will shut down most, if not all, coal-powered electricity plans in America. Remember what Hillary Clinton said? She wants to shut down the miners, just like she wants to shut down the steel mills.  We're going to put our great miners and steel workers back to work.  Energy reform is central to our plan as well According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, President Obama's energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person. Hillary Clinton wants to go even further, and her plan could cost the economy $5 trillion dollars.  A Trump Administration will lift restrictions on all sources of American energy production. According to the Institute for American Energy Resources this will: increase GDP by more than $100 billion annually add over 500,000 new jobs annually increase annual wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion over 4 decades increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion over the next 40 years. In addition, we will streamline the permitting process for all energy infrastructure projects, including the billions of dollars in projects held up by President Obama – creating countless more jobs in the process.  Finally, comes trade – the foundation for everything America's annual trade deficit with the world is now nearly $800 a billion a year – an enormous drag on growth.  Between World War II and the year 2000, the United States averaged a 3.5% growth rate. But, after China joined the World Trade Organization, our average growth rate has been reduced to only 2 percent.  Predatory trade practices, product dumping, currency manipulation and intellectual property theft have taken millions of jobs and trillions in wealth from our country.  It is no great secret that many of the special interests funding my opponent's campaign are the same people profiting from these terrible trade deals. The same so-called experts advising Hillary Clinton are the same people who gave us NAFTA, China's entry into the World Trade Organization, the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and now the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  The verdict is in. All of the special interests that the media race to for comment have been proven wrong about every single deal they've promoted – every lie and every prediction has crashed upon the rocks of reality.  Our manufacturing base has crumbled, communities have been hollowed out, wages have declined, and households are making less today than they were in the year 2000.  I have proposed a detailed plan to reform our trade policies and bring vast new jobs and wealth to America. This includes the following steps: I'm going to direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify every violation of trade agreements a foreign country is currently using to harm our workers. I will use every tool under American and international law to end these abuses, and I will use our greatest business leaders and finest negotiators – and I know who you are, many of you are in the room.  We are going to start with NAFTA, which is causing so much damage to our country.   We will entirely renegotiate NAFTA into a deal that will either be good for us or will be terminated until a brand new and productive deal can be signed.  We are also going to keep America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Next, I am going to instruct my Treasury Secretary to label China a currency manipulator, and to apply tariffs to any country that devalues its currency to gain an unfair advantage over the United States. I am going to instruct the U.S. Trade Representative to bring trade cases against China. China's unfair subsidy behavior is prohibited by the terms of its entrance to the WTO, and I intend to enforce those rules.  If China does not stop its illegal activities, including its theft of American trade secrets and intellectual property, I will apply countervailing duties until China ceases and desists.  Just the single action of enforcing intellectual property rules alone would add millions of new American jobs. According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America's intellectual property in China would add 2 million jobs a year to the United States every single year.  We are going to stop the outflow of jobs from our country, and open a new highway of jobs back into our country.  Here is how the plan adds up. We are proposing a $4.4 trillion tax cut that will score as $2.6 trillion under a dynamic growth model, which is how taxes should be scored. This includes the childcare plan.  Our economic team has further modeled that the growth-induced savings from trade, energy and regulation reform will shave at least another $1.8 trillion off of the remaining cost.  That leaves around $800 billion dollars. This money can all be saved through simple, common sense reforms. If we save just one penny of each federal dollar spent on non-defense, and non-entitlement programs, we can save almost $1 trillion over the next decade – again this is spending that does not touch defense, and that does not touch entitlements.  If our plan exceeds the 3.5% ten-year growth average, then our jobs proposal will actually reduce the deficit. Savings will be compounded by the fact that people who are currently receiving unemployment or welfare will finally be able to find jobs.  This is the most pro-growth, pro-jobs, pro-family plan put forth perhaps in the history of our country. This is what our new future will look like.   I am going to lower you taxes; I am going to get rid of massive amounts of unnecessary regulations, on business and in your life; I'm going to unleash American energy; I'm going to repeal and replace Obamacare; I'm going to appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will follow the Constitution; I'm going rebuild our depleted military and take care of our vets; I'm going to save your 2nd amendment; I'm going to stop illegal immigration and drugs coming into our country, and yes, we will build the wall [Mexico will pay]; and I'm going to renegotiate our disastrous trade deals, especially NAFTA – and we will only make great trade deals that put the American worker first.  And we are going to put our miners and our steelworkers back to work. We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals. American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas. American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.  American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.  We will put new American metal into the spine of this country.  Jobs will return, incomes will rise, and new factories will come rushing back to our shores.  We Will Make America Wealthy Again. We Will Make America Strong Again. And Will Make America Great Again.

TRUMP ADDRESSES CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES  It is so great to be back in New Hampshire. I have developed such deep affection for this state and for its people. My first victory took place here.  Over the next 74 days, we are all going to work very hard together to win this state – just like we did in the primaries – and to win the White House for the American people.  Our victory is going to be a victory for the great majority of Americans whose voice has not been heard.  Year after year, we live under a Washington regime that ignores your demands, rejects your cries for help, and that always puts your needs last.  The real divide in this election is not between left and right, but between everyday working people and a corrupt political establishment that works only for itself.  This election is a chance for the great majority of decent citizens to end the rule of a small group of special interests and to return that power to the voters.  Hillary Clinton believes only in government of, by and for the powerful.  I am promising government of, by and for the people.  In this fight, we are taking on some very entrenched and well-financed interests. These are the same people who pay Hillary $10,000 dollars a minute for a speech. These special interests are the same people who own the newspapers that cover-up her crimes. These are the Wall Street firms who paid Hillary Clinton a quarter of a million dollars each time she delivered her secret remarks. They are the same people who paid Bill and Hillary Clinton over $150 million dollars for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office – and who donated countless millions more to the Clinton Foundation.  But, you have the power, with your vote, to defeat those special interests and put the people back in charge once more.  This has been a historic week in American politics.  The voters have always known that our leadership in Washington D.C. is corrupt, and that the system is very badly rigged.  But this week the curtain was lifted. The corruption was revealed for all to see. The veil was pulled back on a vast criminal enterprise run out of the State Department by Hillary Clinton.  As the Associated Press documented, more than half of the meetings Hillary Clinton took as Secretary of State with people outside government were Foundation donors.  Hillary Clinton\\'s chief of staff received more messages from the Clinton Foundation\\'s Chief Operating Officer than just about anyone else.  85 donors alone that she met with as Secretary gave the Foundation $156 million dollars.  On top of that, Bill Clinton\\'s total speaking fees rose 44% while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State – often raking in money from people who had business or matters before the State Department.  As I said weeks ago, Hillary Clinton ran the State Department like a personal hedge fund.  It is hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ended, and where the State Department began.  Access and favors were sold for cash. It\\'s called Pay-For-Play.  Over and over and over, people who donated to the Clinton Foundation – or who gave money to Bill Clinton – got favorable treatment from Hillary Clinton\\'s State Department.  The examples are too many to name here in full, and I\\'ve gone over some in recent days. They include the deal to sell 20% of U.S. Uranium to Russia, or the favorable treatment for UBS. It includes the exemption of Telecom Giant Ericsson from government sanctions. It includes efforts to put a Foundation donor – with no national security experience – onto a highly-sensitive national security panel with access to top secret information. It includes Foundation donors getting lucrative contracts in Haiti – all while the people of Haiti suffered horribly.  But these examples are only the tip of the Clinton Corruption iceberg.  Hillary Clinton\\'s actions constitute all of the elements of a major criminal enterprise.  She created a private illegal email server in order to hide her corrupt dealings. She did so knowing full well it would put American lives at risk by making classified information highly vulnerable to foreign hacking. But, she didn\\'t care – as long as it helped her get away with her crime, no risk to America was too great.  Then, to further cover-up her crime, she deleted 33,000 emails to keep them out of the hands of authorities and the American public.  As a further element of the criminal cover-up, she claimed under penalty of perjury that she turned over all of her work related emails. We now know this to be one more massive Clinton lie. The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she failed to turn over, including the new discovery this week of 15,000 more work-related emails she failed to disclose.  What is being uncovered now is one of the most shocking scandals in American political history.  A Secretary of State sold her office to corporations and foreign governments, betraying the public trust – putting innocent lives in danger – and then she went to great lengths to hide, delete, destroy and lie about the evidence. Just like her lie that she never sent any material marked classified.  Lie after lie after lie.  This is the corruption we expect to see in a Third World country – but not in America.  Just imagine the damage to our security, to our integrity, to our standing in the world, if Hillary Clinton is allowed to sell the Oval Office the same way she sold her office as Secretary of State.  We cannot let this happen.  We must vote on November 8th to keep the American government from being sold to the highest bidder.  Vote to save your country. Vote to protect your family. Vote for honesty, integrity and accountability.  Now, as all of these revelations have been discovered this week, Hillary Clinton has been in hiding.  But today, she emerges. However, she is emerging not to take responsibility for her unethical and criminal conduct, but instead to make one of the most brazen attempts at distraction in the history of politics.  Now, I have not seen Hillary Clinton\\'s remarks. And, in a sense, I don\\'t want to dignify them by dwelling on them too much, but a response is required for the sake of all decent voters she is trying to smear.  The news reports are that Hillary Clinton is going to try to accuse this campaign, and the millions of decent Americans who support this campaign, of being racists.  It\\'s the oldest play in the Democratic playbook.  When Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument. It\\'s the last refuge of the discredited politician.  They keep going back to this same well, but the well has run dry.  This is the year that the people who have been betrayed by Democratic policies, including millions of African-American and Hispanic-American citizens, reject the politicians who have failed them and vote for change.  As I\\'ve discussed for many days now, Democratic politicians have run nearly every inner city in America for fifty or sixty years or more. Their policies have produced only more poverty, joblessness, and failing schools.  Every policy Hillary Clinton supports is a policy that has failed and betrayed communities of color in this country. But she just doesn\\'t care – she\\'s too busy raking in cash from the people rigging the system.  Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty. 58% of African-American youth are not working. More than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago this year alone.  These are the consequences of Hillary Clinton\\'s policies. She has brought nothing but pain and heartache to our inner cities.  On top of that, she wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent. We should be helping these businesses to grow and expand – but Hillary Clinton is trying to shut them down.  She opposes school choice.  She supports open borders that violate the civil rights of African-Americans by giving their jobs to people here unlawfully.  She supports trade policies that have closed factories in African-American communities and put millions of African-Americans out of work.  She supports radical regulations that put Americans out of work and raise the price of their energy bills.  She supports policies on crime that make communities less safe, and that make it harder to raise your children in security and peace.  I believe every single parent in this country – and especially in the inner cities – has the right to raise their kids in safety. This is one of the great civil rights issues of our time.  But Hillary Clinton doesn\\'t want to talk about any of this. She can\\'t defend her record. She doesn\\'t have one single proposal that hasn\\'t been tried and failed. She doesn\\'t have one idea that does anything but destroy jobs for African-American and Hispanic citizens – and all citizens – in our country.  So what does she do when she can\\'t defend her record?  She lies, she smears, she paints decent Americans as racists. She bullies voters, who only want a better future, and tries to intimidate them out of voting for change.  As I discussed yesterday, these are the same tactics the establishment powers used to try to scare the British people out of voting for change too.  It didn\\'t work there. It won\\'t work here.  The American people are ready to vote for freedom, opportunity and justice. They are ready to take back control of their own futures.  It\\'s time the Clintons were held accountable for their inappropriate conduct. According to the book Game Change, Bill Clinton said about President Barack Obama that \"a few years ago this guy would have been getting us coffee.\" And we\\'ve all seen the cringe-worthy comments from Hillary Clinton, which I won\\'t get into here but we all know what they are.  Here\\'s the important point though that I want to get across today. Hillary Clinton isn\\'t just attacking me, she\\'s attacking all the people who support our movement.  We can\\'t let that stand. Voters are used to the old game where failed politicians like Hillary Clinton falsely smear Republicans with charges of racism. Republicans then back down. Democrats then continue to push policies that are devastating to communities of color.  We must break this corrupt cycle. And we are going to break it beginning today.  So let me make some very clear statements before this whole country.  First, on the border. People who want their laws enforced and respected, and who want their border secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs protected and their country kept safe. I will never apologize for pledging to enforce and uphold every single law of the United States, and to make my immigration priority defending and protecting American citizens above every other single consideration. We will end illegal immigration and we will restore the Constitutional rule of law.  Next, on national security. People who speak out against Radical Islam, and who warn about refugees, are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our values as a tolerant society, and who want to keep the terrorists out of our country. If the choice is between saving lives – or appeasing politically-correct censors in Washington D.C., that is the easiest choice I will ever have to make. I will always choose saving American lives.  Now, on crime. People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence. There is no compassion in tolerating crime, and poisonous drug dealing, and the killings in our streets. I will work to dismantle the criminal gangs and cartels and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and violence and poverty and fear.  To Hillary Clinton, and to her donors and advisors, pushing her to spread her smears and her lies about decent people, I have three words. I want you to hear these words, and remember these words: Shame On You.  When you are like the Clintons, getting $69 million dollars in political contributions from Wall Street and Big Banks, it is easy to look down on the so-called little people. It\\'s easy to ignore the devastation caused by our open borders when you spend all your time with wealthy donors and Hollywood celebrities. It is easy to ignore the heartfelt concerns of communities about Radical Islam entering our country, when you spend your time hanging out with foreign dictators in their lavish palaces. And it is easy, no doubt, for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to the ravages of crime, when she has her own personal armed security force.  This is how the system is rigged.  For decades, the American people have demanded that their immigration laws be enforced and that their jobs be protected from out-of-control immigration. But the special interests, who only want cheap labor, have stopped it from happening.  For years, the American people have worried about letting Radical Islam spread within our shores, but the elites – who only want to raise more money from global corporations – ignore the concerns of the American voters.  For fifty years, people living in our inner cities have suffered under a failed policy regime. But the Democratic politicians – who only want to please media executives and Wall Street donors – do nothing but expand the hurt and the suffering.  It is time for a new day to dawn in America.  On November 8th, we will end the rule of special interests – and we will begin the rule of the people.  I am asking for your vote so that we can break free from the failures of the past and create a New American Future.  I am asking for your vote so that we can achieve amazing things for the American people.  I am asking for the vote of every African-American, and Hispanic-American, who wants a better future – a future that begins with jobs, jobs and more jobs.  We will fix our disastrous trade deals and stand up to countries that cheat.  We will lower taxes and create millions of new jobs as a result.  We will unleash an American energy revolution.  We will eliminate job-killing regulations.  We will repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare.  We will enforce our immigration laws, and we will put rules in place that hire American workers first.  We will end the era of nation-building, and instead work in partnership with our allies to crush and destroy ISIS.  We will keep Radical Islamic Terrorism out of our country.  We will promote the values of tolerance, justice and acceptance.  We will steadfastly reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms.  America will be one nation – united in common purpose and common dreams. Our citizens will proudly promote our values and our system of government as the best in the world – and we will do so without apology.  Together, We Will Make America Prosperous Again.  We Will Make America Proud Again.  We Will Make America Safe Again.  Friends, citizens and fellow Americans: We Will Make America Great Again.  Thank you, and God Bless!   Donald J.

I love this state – where I once worked – and I love the people of this state.   I have a message for all of you tonight: we are going to win Ohio, we are going to win the White House, and we are going to bring back your jobs. We are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put American workers first.  We are going to stop the product dumping, the unfair foreign subsidies, and the currency manipulation.  We are going to stop the foreign cheating.  The era of economic surrender is over.  A new era of American Greatness is beginning.  No state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio.  Hillary Clinton backed her husband\\'s NAFTA, she backed China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organization, she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  One bad deal after another.  Hillary Clinton\\'s donors own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do.  Ohio and the Akron area have lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.  This region and this state have lost nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization.  Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.  This subtracts directly from our growth – our economy grew only 1.2 percent in the last quarter, a total disaster.  This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.    I am promising a new legacy for America. We are going to create a New American Future. But to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.    Our trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year.  Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved.  Hillary Clinton, who called the TPP the \"Gold Standard\", would 100% approve it if she ever got in.  Her closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed that she would.  We won\\'t let that happen.  We will win this election, and we will keep America out of the TPP.  We will defend our freedom, our jobs, and our economic independence.  It\\'s going to be America First.  My economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, and create millions of new jobs.   Here are a few of the things we will do: A massive tax cut for working Americans, and a 15% tax rate for small businesses.  We are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administration\\'s new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent.  These Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are a tax on the poor, and they devastate low-income African-American and Latino workers. Ohio gets 60% of its electricity from coal-powered energy.  Hillary Clinton says she wants to \"put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\"  Just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business.  We are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work – and we are going to get your energy bills down.  We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade.  Another major part of our agenda is law and order.  More than 2,600 have been shot in Chicago alone since the beginning of this year.  This is one of the biggest differences between me and my opponent.  I believe that safety is a right that belongs to all Americans.    Let me take this opportunity to thank the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.  Working with communities and police, I pledge to bring safety to communities across this land – but especially to those places that have not known safety in a very, very long time.  I want every parent and child in this society – including every African-American and Hispanic citizen – to be able to live in a safe, thriving and prosperous community.  This is the New American Future that we are working together to create.  Hillary Clinton is the past.  We are the future.  Another major part of our agenda is immigration security.  We need to protect American jobs.  We need to protect American safety.  Low-income workers are hurt the most by my opponent\\'s policies. Poor Hispanic and African-American citizens are the first to lose a job, or see a pay cut, when we don\\'t control our borders. According to Pew Research, immigration over the next fifty years will add another 100 million to our population.  It will be much, much more than even that under Hillary Clinton\\'s radical plans.  That\\'s unfair to the low-income workers – African-American, Latino, all Americans – living here today and trying to get ahead.  Hillary Clinton has forgotten the first rule of public service.  The job of an elected official is to serve the citizens of the United States.  If you don\\'t understand that, then you cannot run for President. If you are not prepared to put American workers first, then you should not hold or seek public office. It\\'s just that simple.  No issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.  As the evidence has become public over the last several months, I have become increasingly shocked by the vast scope of Hillary Clinton\\'s criminality.   �Hillary Clinton said she turned over all of her work related emails.  She testified that to Congress under penalty of perjury. Now we learn about another 15,000 emails she failed to turn over have just been discovered.     Colin Powell just proved again how dishonest Hillary Clinton is after he busted her for trying to pin her email scandal on him – one more Hillary Clinton lie.     Her Foundation took in large payments from major corporations and wealthy individuals, foreign and domestic, all while she was Secretary of State.   The Clinton Foundation accepted as much as $60 million dollars from Middle Eastern countries that oppress women, gays and people of different faiths.   The Foundation donors included corporations and individuals with significant matters before the State Department. And then either Hillary Clinton herself or one of her closest aides took action favorable to the donor.   Her actions corrupted and disgraced one of the most important Departments of government, indeed one of only four established by the United States Constitution itself.   The Clintons\\' made the State Department into the same kind of Pay-to-Play operations as the Arkansas Government was: pay the Clinton Foundation huge sums of money and throw in some big speaking fees for Bill Clinton and you got to play with the State Department.   The amounts involved, the favors done and the significant numbers of times it was done require an expedited investigation by a Special Prosecutor. After the FBI and Department of Justice whitewash of the Clinton email crimes, they certainly cannot be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate Hillary Clinton\\'s crimes.   Some former prosecutors have even suggested that the coordination between the pay-for-play State Department and the corrupt Clinton Foundation constitute a clear example of a RICO (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization) enterprise.   The Justice Department is required to appoint an independent Special Prosecutor because it has proven itself to be a political arm of the White House.     The DOJ has acted very unethically, particularly the Attorney General\\'s private lengthy meeting with Bill Clinton shortly before the Department\\'s decision not to prosecute her for crimes that would have been prosecuted against almost any other citizen.   If the Justice Department fails to do so, it will make it even clearer that a second of the four primary constitutional Departments have been corrupted.   Here is one example of Clinton Corruption.   As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America\\'s uranium supply to the Russians. Clinton\\'s approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars. In exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations. In addition, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal.   �Here is another example of pay-for-play.   �In 2009, Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S. pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments – including Sudan, Syria, and Iran.  Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people.  In June 2011, Hillary Clinton\\'s State Department began adding goods and services to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism.  During that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000 – his highest paying speech.  In April 2012, the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria –but those sanctions did not cover Ericsson\\'s work in Iran.  A Trump Administration will end the government corruption.  No one will be above the law.  We will have one set of rules for everyone.  In Hillary Clinton\\'s world, we have one set of rules for her – and another set of rules for everyone else. I am fighting for everyone who doesn\\'t have a voice.  The forgotten men and women of America. I am your voice.  Hillary Clinton\\'s campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers.  My campaign is powered by my own money, but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back.  Nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5, 10, or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters.  Come November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you, your family, and your country.  We are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas, and remember those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.  We are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat, and utterly destroy ISIS.  We are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don\\'t support our tolerant values.  We are also going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees people of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future. The Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city for half a century or more.  They have produced only more poverty, failing schools, and broken homes.  In the last eight years, the African-American labor force participation has declined another 3 percentage points – and it\\'s dropped another 6 percent for teenagers.  Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty.  African-American home ownership has declined nearly ten percentage points.  Meanwhile, since 2009, another 2 million Latinos have fallen into poverty.  Incomes for Latino workers fell by almost another $1,000 dollars. Meanwhile, homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and more than 60 percent in Baltimore.  The level of crime in these cities is something no American should consider acceptable.  Our government has failed these residents.  For those hurting the most – who have been failed again and again by their politicians – I\\'ve asked in recent days, what do you have to lose by trying something new?  If you keep voting for the same failed politicians you will keep getting the same results.  But, most importantly, I want to talk about what you have to gain.  Those hurting in our county have so much to gain by joining our campaign for a new, and more inclusive, American Future.  My tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses.    My energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the price of your energy bill.  My trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country.  My immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visa programs that hurt poor workers.  My infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, bridges and airports.  My regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive, and for young children to live out their dreams.  My promise of school choice, charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities.  Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice.  My government reforms will make your voice heard – not the voice of the special interests. Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton. It\\'s the powerful protecting the powerful. Insiders fighting for insiders.  I am fighting for you.  Every day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign.  Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign.  Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign. I wear their opposition as a badge of honor.  Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change.    I am fighting – all of us across the country are fighting – for peaceful regime change in our own country.  The media-donor-political complex that\\'s bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.  I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.  We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity – a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.  I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.    To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I\\'m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.

It's great to be here in Charlotte. I just met with our many amazing employees right up the road at our property.  I'd like to take a moment to talk about the heartbreak and devastation in Louisiana, a state that is very special to me.  We are one nation. When one state hurts, we all hurt – and we must all work together to lift each other up. Working, building, restoring together.  Our prayers are with the families who have lost loved ones, and we send them our deepest condolences. Though words cannot express the sadness one feels at times like this, I hope everyone in Louisiana knows that our country is praying for them and standing with them to help them in these difficult hours.  We are one country, one people, and we will have together one great future.  Tonight, I'd like to talk about the New American Future we are going to create together.  Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.  On Monday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.  On Tuesday, in Wisconsin, I talked about how we are going to restore law and order to this country.  Let me take this opportunity to extend our thanks and our gratitude to the police and law enforcement officers in this country who have sacrificed so greatly in these difficult times.  The chaos and violence on our streets, and the assaults on law enforcement, are an attack against all peaceful citizens. If I am elected President, this chaos and violence will end – and it will end very quickly.  Every single citizen in our land has a right to live in safety.  To be one united nation, we must protect all of our people. But we must also provide opportunities for all of our people.  We cannot make America Great Again if we leave any community behind.  Nearly Four in ten African-American children are living in poverty.I will not rest until children of every color in this country are fully included in the American Dream.  Jobs, safety, opportunity. Fair and equal representation. This is what I promise to African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and all Americans.  But to achieve this New American Future we must break from the failures of the past.  As you know, I am not a politician. I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life. I've never wanted to use the language of the insiders, and I've never been politically correct – it takes far too much time, and can often make more difficult.  Sometimes, in the heat of debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don't choose the right words or you say the wrong thing. I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain. Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.  But one thing I can promise you is this: I will always tell you the truth.  I speak the truth for all of you, and for everyone in this country who doesn't have a voice.  I speak the truth on behalf of the factory worker who lost his or her job.  I speak the truth on behalf of the Veteran who has been denied the medical care they need – and so many are not making it. They are dying.  I speak the truth on behalf of the family living near the border that deserves to be safe in their own country but is instead living with no security at all.  Our campaign is about representing the great majority of Americans – Republicans, Democrats, Independents, Conservatives and Liberals – who read the newspaper, or turn on the TV, and don't hear anyone speaking for them. All they hear are insiders fighting for insiders.  These are the forgotten men and women in our society, and they are angry at so much on so many levels. The poverty, the unemployment, the failing schools, the jobs moving to other countries.  I am fighting for these forgotten Americans.  Fourteen months ago, I declared my campaign for the Presidency on the promise to give our government back to the people. Every day since then, I've worked to repay the loyalty and the faith that you have put in me.  Every day I think about how much is at stake for this country. This isn't just the fight of my life, it's the fight of our lives – together – to save our country.  I refuse to let another generation of American children be excluded from the American Dream. Our whole country loses when young people of limitless potential are denied the opportunity to contribute their talents because we failed to provide them the opportunities they deserved. Let our children be dreamers too.  Our whole country loses every time a kid doesn't graduate from high school, or fails to enter the workforce or, worse still, is lost to the dreadful world of drugs and crime.  When I look at the failing schools, the terrible trade deals, and the infrastructure crumbling in our inner cities, I know all of this can be fixed - and it can be fixed very quickly.  In the world I come from, if something is broken, you fix it.  If something isn't working, you replace it.  If a product doesn't deliver, you make a change.  I have no patience for injustice, no tolerance for government incompetence, no sympathy for leaders who fail their citizens.  That's why I am running: to end the decades of bitter failure and to offer the American people a new future of honesty, justice and opportunity. A future where America, and its people, always – and I mean always – come first.  Aren't you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?  Aren't you tired of the same old lies and the same old broken promises? And Hillary Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time.  Aren't you tired of arrogant leaders who look down on you, instead of serving and protecting you?  That is all about to change – and it's about to change soon. We are going to put the American people first again.  I've travelled all across this country laying out my bold and modern agenda for change.  In this journey, I will never lie to you. I will never tell you something I do not believe. I will never put anyone's interests ahead of yours.  And, I will never, ever stop fighting for you.  I have no special interest. I am spending millions of dollars on my own campaign – nobody else is.  My only interest is the American people.  So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth. One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day.  The American people are still waiting for Hillary Clinton to apologize for all of the many lies she's told to them, and the many times she's betrayed them.  Tell me, has Hillary Clinton ever apologized for lying about her illegal email server and deleting 33,000 emails?  Has Hillary Clinton apologized for turning the State Department into a pay-for-play operation where favors are sold to the highest bidder?  Has she apologized for lying to the families who lost loved ones at Benghazi?  Has she apologized for putting Iran on the path to nuclear weapons?  Has she apologized for Iraq? For Libya? For Syria? Has she apologized for unleashing ISIS across the world?  Has Hillary Clinton apologized for the decisions she made that have led to so much death, destruction and terrorism?  Speaking of lies, we now know from the State Department announcement that President Obama lied about the $400 million dollars in cash that was flown to Iran. He denied it was for the hostages, but it was. He said we don't pay ransom, but he did. He lied about the hostages – openly and blatantly – just like he lied about Obamacare.  Now the Administration has put every American travelling overseas, including our military personnel, at greater risk of being kidnapped. Hillary Clinton owns President Obama's Iran policy, one more reason she can never be allowed to be President.  Let's talk about the economy. Here, in this beautiful state, so many people have suffered because of NAFTA. Bill Clinton signed the deal, and Hillary Clinton supported it. North Carolina has lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs since NAFTA went into effect.  Bill Clinton also put China into the World Trade Organization – another Hillary Clinton-backed deal. Your city of Charlotte has lost 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China joined the WTO, and many of these jobs were lost while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State – our chief diplomat with China. She was a disaster, totally unfit for the job.  Hillary Clinton owes the State of North Carolina a very big apology, and I think you'll get that apology around the same time you'll get to see her 33,000 deleted emails.  Another major issue in this campaign has been the border. Our open border has allowed drugs and crime and gangs to pour into our communities. So much needless suffering, so much preventable death. I've spent time with the families of wonderful Americans whose loved ones were killed by the open borders and Sanctuary Cities that Hillary Clinton supports.  I've embraced the crying parents who've lost their children to violence spilling across our border. Parents like Laura Wilkerson and Michelle Root and Sabine Durden and Jamiel Shaw whose children were killed by illegal immigrants.  My opponent supports Sanctuary Cities.  But where was the Sanctuary for Kate Steinle? Where was the Sanctuary for the children of Laura, Michelle, Sabine and Jamiel?  Where was the Sanctuary for every other parent who has suffered so horribly?  These moms and dads don't get a lot of consideration from our politicians. They certainly don't get apologies. They'll never even get the time of day from Hillary Clinton.  But they will always come first to me.  Listen closely: we will deliver justice for all of these American Families. We will create a system of immigration that makes us all proud.  Hillary Clinton's mistakes destroy innocent lives, sacrifice national security, and betray the working families of this country.  Please remember this: I will never put personal profit before national security. I will never leave our border open to appease donors and special interests. I will never support a trade deal that kills American jobs. I will never put the special interests before the national interest. I will never put a donor before a voter, or a lobbyist before a citizen.  Instead, I will be a champion for the people.  The establishment media doesn't cover what really matters in this country, or what's really going on in people's lives. They will take words of mine out of context and spend a week obsessing over every single syllable, and then pretend to discover some hidden meaning in what I said.  Just imagine for a second if the media spent this energy holding the politicians accountable who got innocent Americans like Kate Steinle killed – she was gunned down by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times.  Just imagine if the media spent this much time investigating the poverty and joblessness in our inner cities.  Just think about how much different things would be if the media in this country sent their cameras to our border, or to our closing factories, or to our failing schools. Or if the media focused on what dark secrets must be hidden in the 33,000 emails Hillary Clinton deleted.  Instead, every story is told from the perspective of the insiders. It's the narrative of the people who rigged the system, never the voice of the people it's been rigged against.  So many people suffering in silence. No cameras, no coverage, no outrage from a media class that seems to get outraged over just about everything else.  So again, it's not about me. It's never been about me. It's about all the people in this country who don't have a voice.  I am running to be their voice.  I am running to be the voice for every forgotten part of this country that has been waiting and hoping for a better future.  I am glad that I make the powerful a little uncomfortable now and again – including some powerful people in my own party. Because it means I am fighting for real change.  There's a reason the hedge fund managers, the financial lobbyists, the Wall Street investors, are throwing their money at Hillary Clinton. Because they know she will make sure the system stays rigged in their favor.  It's the powerful protecting the powerful.  The insiders fighting for the insiders.  I am fighting for you.  Here is the change I propose.  On terrorism, we are going to end the era of nation-building and instead focus on destroying ISIS and Radical Islamic terrorism.  We will use military, cyber and financial warfare and work with any partner in the world, and the Middle East, that shares our goal of defeating terrorism. I have a message for the terrorists trying to kill our citizens: we will find you, we will destroy you, and we will win.  On immigration, we will temporarily suspend immigration from any place where adequate screening cannot be performed. All applicants for immigration will be vetted for ties to radical ideology, and we will screen out anyone who doesn't share our values and love our people. Anyone who believes Sharia law supplants American law will not be given an immigrant visa. If you want to join our society, then you must embrace our society, our values and our tolerant way of life. Those who believe in oppressing women, gays, Hispanics, African-Americans and people of different faiths are not welcome to join our country.  We will promote our America values, our American way of life, and our American system of government which are all the best in the world.  My opponent on the other hand wants a 550% increase in Syrian refugees. Her plan would bring in roughly 620,000 refugees from all refugee-sending nations in her first term, on top of all other immigration. Hillary Clinton is running to be America's Angela Merkel, and we've seen how much crime and how many problems that's caused the German people.  We have enough problems already, we don't need another one.  On crime, we are going to add more police, more investigators, and appoint the best judges and prosecutors in the world. We will pursue strong enforcement of federal laws.  The gangs and cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our people will be stripped apart one by one. Their day is over.  On trade, we are going to renegotiate NAFTA, withdraw from the TPP, stand up to China on our terrible trade agreement, and protect every last American job.  Hillary Clinton has supported all of the major trade deals that have stripped this country of its jobs and its wealth.  On taxes, we are going to massively cut tax rates for workers and small businesses – creating millions of new good paying jobs.  We are going to get rid of regulations that send jobs overseas and we are going to make it easier for young Americans to get the credit they need to start a small business and pursue their dreams.  On education, we are going to give students choice, and allow charter schools to thrive. We are going to end tenure policies that reward bad teachers and hurt good ones. My opponent wants to deny students choice and opportunity, all to get a little bit more money from the education bureaucracy. She doesn't care how many young dreams are dashed in the process.  We are going to work closely with African-American parents and students in the inner cities – and what a big difference that will make. This means a lot to me, and it is going to be a top priority in a Trump Administration.  On healthcare, we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare. Countless Americans have been forced into part-time jobs, premiums are about to jump by double-digits yet again, and just this week Aetna announced it is pulling out of the exchanges in North Carolina. We are going to replace this disaster with reforms that give you choice and freedom and control in healthcare – at a much lower cost.  On political corruption, we are going to restore honor to our government.  In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information. No one will be above the law.  I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.  I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government.  Finally, we are going to bring this country together. We are going to do it by emphasizing what we all have in common as Americans. We are going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, which sees communities of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future.  If African-American voters give Donald Trump a chance by giving me their vote, the result for them will be amazing. Look at how badly things are going under decades of Democratic leadership – look at the schools, look at the 58% of young African-Americans not working. It is time for change.  What do you have to lose by trying something new? – I will fix it. This means so much to me, and I will work as hard as I can to bring new opportunity to places in our country which have not known opportunity in a very long time.  Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party have taken African-American votes totally for granted. Because the votes have been automatically there, there has been no reason for Democrats to produce.  It is time to break with the failures of the past, and to fight for every last American child in this country to have the better future they deserve.  In my Administration, every American will be treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally. We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future built on our common culture and values as one American people.  This is the change I am promising all of you: an honest government, a fair economy, and a just society for each and every American.  But we can never fix our problems by relying on the same politicians who created these problems in the first place.  72% of voters say our country is on the wrong track. I am the change candidate, Hillary Clinton is the failed status quo.  It is time to vote for a New American Future.  Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.  We Will Make American Proud Again.  We Will Make America Safe Again.  Friends and fellow citizens: Come November, We Will Make America Great Again.  Thank You, And God Bless.\", 'link_name': '', 'status_type': 'status', 'status_link': '', 'status_published': '8/18/2016 19:49:49', 'num_reactions': '35878', 'num_comments': '5535', 'num_shares': '6306', 'num_likes': '31407', 'num_loves': '4051', 'num_wows': '227', 'num_hahas': '96', 'num_sads': '23', 'num_angrys': '74'}, {'status_id': '153080620724_10157521443780725', 'status_message': 'Crooked Hillary Clinton #ThrowbackThursday:', 'link_name': '', 'status_type': 'video', 'status_link': 'https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/videos/10157521443780725/', 'status_published': '8/18/2016 16:59:02', 'num_reactions': '73575', 'num_comments': '8595', 'num_shares': '84663', 'num_likes': '61640', 'num_loves': '1249', 'num_wows': '658', 'num_hahas': '4170', 'num_sads': '152', 'num_angrys': '5706'}, {'status_id': '153080620724_10157510424610725', 'status_message': 'It\\'s so great to be here tonight.  I am honored to also be joined this evening by Governor Scott Walker, Chairman Reince Prebius, and Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  We are at a decisive moment in this election.  Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.  Yesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.  Tonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness.  Let me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.  The violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.  Law and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities.  The main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods.  It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result. There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct.  Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.  The narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one.  The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.    More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs. Just like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police. You know it, and I know it.  Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society – a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent – share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country.  They have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.  Everytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives – whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore – and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities.  During the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded.  More than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and almost 4,000 killed in President Obama\\'s hometown area since his presidency began. How are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers?  The war on our police must end.  It must end now!  The war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety.   Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor.  Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets.  Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus.  Or the young child walking home from school.  For every one violent protestor, there are a hundred of moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.  My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.  Hillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities.  I care too much about my country to let that happen.   We all care too much about our country to let that happen. Good policing saves lives.    My dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this.  The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent.  Think of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed.  Imagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country, if Democratic politicians hadn\\'t blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City?  I\\'ll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee, and all across this country. It\\'s easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force.  I believe all Americans, not just the powerful, are entitled to security.  Hillary Clinton has had her chance.  She failed.  Now it\\'s time for new leadership. The Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most.  There is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons to prey on innocent people.  It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American – and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very, very long time. I am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future.  It is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths.  The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community.  Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.  Let us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade.  Last year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings.  18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims.  The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average.  Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job.  Nearly Four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty.  55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil. There is only a 60% graduation rate, and it\\'s one of the worst public school systems in the country.  1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China, and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit.  To every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in every inner city, or every forgotten stretch of our society, I am running to offer you a better future.   The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted.  They\\'ve just assumed they\\'ll get your support and done nothing in return for it.  It\\'s time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes, and it\\'s time to rebuild the inner cities of America – and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system.  I\\'m not part of the corrupt system. In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me.  I\\'ve been paying my own way.  The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system.    The other party – the Democratic Party – nominated the personification of special interest corruption.  The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests.  I am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help.  The quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.  Jobs. Safety. Opportunity. Fair and equal representation.  We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.  She doesn\\'t care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them.  The African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party.  It\\'s time to break with the failures of the past – I want to offer Americans a new future. It is time for rule by the people, not rule by special interests.  Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.  The hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors, the professional political class.    It\\'s the powerful protecting the powerful.  Insiders fighting for insiders.    I am fighting for you!  When we talk about the insider, who are we talking about?  It\\'s the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests.  It\\'s the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill.  It\\'s the financial industry knows how to regulate their competition out of existence.  The insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists in Washington, Los Angeles, and New York City, who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change.  Every day you pick up a newspaper, or turn on the nightly news, and hear about how some banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign.  Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign.  Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.  I wear their opposition as a badge of honor.  Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change.  I am fighting – all of us across the country are fighting – for peaceful regime change in our own country.  The media-donor-political complex that\\'s bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.  The leadership class in Washington D.C., of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years, has abandoned the people of this country.  I am going to give the people their voice back. Think about it.  The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result.  The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another. The people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another.  Aren\\'t you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?  Aren\\'t you tired of big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard?  Are you ready for change?  Are you ready for leadership that puts you, the American people, first? That puts your country first? That puts your family first? Let\\'s talk about what this means for the inner cities of America.    It\\'s time to break through the television noise, the entrenched interests.  I understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system – a lot of people who\\'ve created our problems – will lose a lot of their contracts, and their special gigs, if African-American voters, and all minority voters, support my campaign.    It\\'s time to stop making the special interests rich.  It\\'s time to make the American people rich.  I am going to Make America Wealthy Again.  The Democratic Party has run every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin.  They\\'ve ruined the schools.   They\\'ve driven out the jobs.  They\\'ve tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.  Violent crime has risen 17% in America\\'s 50 largest cities last year.  Killings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent.  Homicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore. They are up more than 50% in Washington, D.C.    This is future offered by Hillary Clinton. More poverty, more crime, and more of the same.  The future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine.  It is time for a different future.   Here is what I am proposing.  First, on immigration.  No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton\\'s immigration policies than the African-American community.  Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans.  I will secure our border, protect our workers, and improve jobs and wages in your community. We will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values, who support our Constitution, and who love all of our people.  On trade, I am going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, withdraw from the TPP, and protect every last American job. On taxes, I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores – and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave.  I am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America, and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee.  Every policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas. I am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States.  On education, it is time to have school choice, merit pay for teachers, and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers. We are going to put students and parents first.   Hillary Clinton would deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children, just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy.  I am going to allow charter schools to thrive, and help young kids get on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.  On crime, I am going to support more police in our communities, appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country, pursue strong enforcement of federal laws, and I am going to break up the gangs, the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods.  To every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country, I say: your free reign will soon come crashing to an end.  On healthcare, we are going to get rid of Obamacare – which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases – and give choice to patients and consumers.  Aetna, just today, announced they are dropping out – as are many of the major insurance companies.  On government corruption, I am going to restore honor to our government.  We\\'ve seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton, the mass email deletions, the pay-for-play at the State Department, the profiteering, the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense.  We\\'ve seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme, risk innocent American lives, and bring dishonor onto our government. In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information.  No one will be above the law. I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.  I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government. This is all just the beginning.  We are going to make this a government of the people once again.  This is our chance to take back power from all the people who\\'ve taken it from you.  The reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community.  These are tough times.  But I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before.  To do this, we are going to need a fighter in the White House.  I will be your fighter.  To defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina.  Hillary Clinton doesn\\'t have that strength and stamina.  She cannot win for you.  Most importantly, she has bad judgment.  Bad judgment on terrorism, bad judgement on foreign policy, bad judgment on trade.   The only individuals she\\'s ever delivered for is her donors – not the people.  I\\'ve said it before, and I\\'ll say it again.  My opponent asks her supporters to repeat three-word pledge.    Her pledge reads: \"I\\'m With Her.\"  I choose to recite a different pledge.  My pledge reads: \"I\\'m With You – the American people.\"  I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.  We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity – a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.  I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.  We will once again be a country of law and order, and a country of great success.  To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I\\'m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.  Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.  We Will Make American Safe Again.  And We Will Make America Great Again.    Thank you, and God Bless, Donald J.

It\\'s wonderful to be in Detroit. We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America.  It\\'s a conversation about how to Make American Great Again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least.  The City of Detroit Is Where Our Story Begins Detroit was once the economic envy of the world.  The people of Detroit helped power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century. When we were governed by an America First policy, Detroit was booming.  Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the American Dream. But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.  When we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.  The skyscrapers went up in Beijing, and in many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in Detroit.  Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense.  Today, Detroit has a per capita income of under $15,000 dollars, about half of the national average.  40 percent of the city\\'s residents live in poverty, over two-and-half times the national average. The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average. Half of all Detroit residents do not work. Detroit tops the list of Most Dangerous Cities in terms of violent crime – these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent.    In short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent\\'s failed economic agenda.  Every policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.   She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community…and the crime policies that have made you less safe…and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets...and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries… and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity.   She is the candidate of the past.   Ours is the campaign of the future.   This is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results.   Today, I will outline my economic vision.  In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.   Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas.  All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and American production.     If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn\\'t do better than Hillary Clinton\\'s economic agenda.     Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence.   The one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States.  Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.   That\\'s why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.   My campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first.   Here is what an America First economic plan looks like.   First, let\\'s talk tax reform.   Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.   Hillary Clinton – who has spent her career voting for tax increases – plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase.  Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.     Recently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited again – to use a now famous term – when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.   I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs.   The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete.    As part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers.   Tax simplification will be a major feature of the plan.   Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance.   My plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process.  We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent.  For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero.   While we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity.  These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation.     We will Make America Grow Again.   In the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family.  It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.   The State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton\\'s failed leadership.  The Washington Post just published a devastating article on Hillary Clinton\\'s broken promises.  She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator.  But what happened?  The Washington Post writes, and I quote: \"upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent…the former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislation… Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run…data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during Clinton\\'s first term.\"   Compare that to my record.  In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, \"How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,\" the paper writes that I – and this is a direct quote – \"waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out…almost by force of will — [he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.\"   This is what I want to do for our country – I want to jumpstart America.   Now let\\'s look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally.   Their policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and a doubling of the national debt.   There are now 94.3 million Americans outside the labor force.  It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of nearly 14 million people.   The Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans.   Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.   Nearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since President Obama took office.  Another nearly 7 million Americans are living in poverty.   We have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.   58 percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.   1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force.  These are the real unemployment numbers – the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.   Meanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago.   The average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes.  On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent.  The United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent.   It\\'s almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level.   In other words, we punish companies for making products in America – but let them ship products into the U.S. tax-free if they move overseas. This is backwards.  All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States.  Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes.  Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan.  Hillary Clinton\\'s plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business.  I am going to cut regulations massively. Our lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country – and into cities like Detroit.   To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments.  No one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans. My plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes. We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas.  Our plan will bring that cash home, applying a 10 percent tax.  This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan.  Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax.  American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death – it\\'s just plain wrong. We will repeal it. Next comes regulatory reform  As with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want to keep jobs and wealth in America  Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country. The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980.  It is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year – that\\'s money taken straight out of cities like yours. The federal register is now over 80,000 pages long. As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more. In 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations – each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy. It is time to remove the anchor dragging us down.  Upon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations.  My running mate, Mike Pence, signed a similar order when he became governor of Indiana. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses.  I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders. Next, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs.  Those regulations will be eliminated. We are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win.  When I am president, we will.   One of the most important reforms of all is trade reform.   As Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment.  We\\'ve seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria.  We\\'ve seen it in Iran.  We\\'ve seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment. But we\\'ve also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here in Detroit Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth.   She supported Bill Clinton\\'s NAFTA, she supported China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Let\\'s talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers.    President Obama, and the usual so-called experts who\\'ve been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion – resulting in some 70,000 jobs.  Like Hillary Clinton\\'s broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute.  Our exports to South Korea haven\\'t increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion – more than doubling our trade deficit with that country.  The next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Hillary Clinton\\'s closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. Guaranteed.  Her donors will make sure of it. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP – and it\\'s also a vote for NAFTA. Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion.  Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year.  This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole.    According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan.  Today, that number is only 160,000 Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton\\'s apology. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.  Hillary Clinton\\'s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry.  In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal.  According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs.  Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved.  That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen.  Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests.  Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website.  It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA.  If we don\\'t get a better deal, we will walk away.  At the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China.  This alone could return millions of jobs into our economy.    China is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit.  They break the rules in every way imaginable.  China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property.  They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers. Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs.  According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America\\'s intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States. Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.  Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade.  But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers.  Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are.  Also critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform. The Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses.   As a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs. Hillary Clinton says her plan will \"put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.\"     We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work.   Clinton not only embraces President Obama\\'s job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans.   According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.   A Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.   According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will:   • Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years;   • Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades;   • Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years.     The reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning   When we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity.   We can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.     As part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families.  I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts.   Likewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice.   We will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country.  Without security, there can be no prosperity.  We must have law and order.   In the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items.  One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.   We will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide – saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country.   We also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration.  This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.   Detroit – the Motor City – will come roaring back.  We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past.   Our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system.   The other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday – who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.   There will be no change under Hillary Clinton – only four more years of Obama.   But we are going to look boldly into the future.  We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves.   American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas.   American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.   We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation.   It will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy - mined from American sources - that powers this country.  It will be American workers who are hired to do the job.  Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.  Our country will reach amazing new heights.  All we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past.  We can\\'t fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.  We can\\'t solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them.  Only by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results.  We need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America.   Before everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn\\'t be done.   America is ready to prove the doubters wrong.   They want you to think small.  I am asking you to think big.   We are ready to dream great things for our country once again.   We are ready to show the world that America is Back – Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before.

In his speech yesterday, \"Declaring American Economic Independence,\" Donald J. Trump made the case for Americanism over Hillary Clinton\\'s Globalism, and detailed how the Trans-Pacific Partnership would undermine U.S. sovereignty and economic prosperity. He announced he would withdraw from the TPP and negotiate bilateral trade deals that protect U.S. economic interests. He then challenged Hillary Clinton, longtime enthusiastic booster of the TPP, if she too would pledge to withdraw from the pact and rule out its passage in any form. Clinton now weakly says she only has issues with the TPP \"currently...in its current form,\" politician-speak for saying she will approve it at the very earliest opportunity. This would follow her same pattern of behavior on the Columbia and South Korea trade deals.Good luck though finding her for an answer: it\\'s been 208 days since she last held a press conferences  Relevant excerpt follows below. Read the full footnoted speech here: \"Declaring American Economic Independence\"   TRUMP: \"The TPP creates a new international commission that makes decisions the American people are no longer given the right to veto. These commissions are great for Hillary\\'s Wall Street funders, who can spend vast amounts of money to influence the people on the commissions and the outcomes.  It should be no surprise, then, that Hillary Clinton, according to Bloomberg, took a leading part in drafting the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Please remember that, especially in November.  She praised or pushed the TPP on 45 separate occasions, and even called it the gold standard. Hillary Clinton was totally for the TPP just a short while ago.  But when she saw my stance — which is totally against — she was shamed into saying she would be against it, too. And I will tell you, it was the same shame that she had recently where she was sort of forced into saying radical \"Islamic terrorism,\" which she didn\\'t want to say, but she was shamed into that.  But have no doubt that she will immediately approve it, if it is put before her. And that is guaranteed. Guaranteed.  She will do this, just as she has betrayed American workers for Wall Street and throughout — throughout her career. Her whole career she has betrayed the American worker. She is trying to put on a good front now, she will betray you again.  Her career and her husband have signed so many disasters and never, ever forget NAFTA. Just never ever forget it, because you know what it\\'s done and I know what it\\'s done. And in touring, I\\'ve seen the devastation that it\\'s left behind.  Here\\'s how it would go. She would make a small token change, declare the TPP Pact fixed and ram it through and you will suffer. That is why Hillary is now only saying she has problems with TPP in its current form.

TRUMP ON THE STAKES OF THE ELECTION  Today I\\'d like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.  People have asked me why I am running for President.  I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.  We come to work together and turn visions into reality.  We think big, and then we make it happen.  I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.  So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.  When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton – only by me.  The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!  Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can\\'t solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.  We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.  The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.  That\\'s why we\\'re asking Bernie Sanders\\' voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.  Because it\\'s not just the political system that\\'s rigged. It\\'s the whole economy.  It\\'s rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.  It\\'s rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.  It\\'s rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.  It\\'s rigged against you, the American people.  Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar –  just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.[1]  Brian Williams\\' career was destroyed for saying far less.  Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars. I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs. That is a talent our country desperately needs.  I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.  We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.  This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.  Here is my promise to the American voter:  If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.  The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests – and taking money from special interests.  Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.  She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund – doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.  Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests – in less than 2 years – secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public. [2] [3]  Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.[4]  They totally own her, and that will never change.  The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.  Those are the stakes.  Hillary Clinton wants to be President. But she doesn\\'t have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders\\' said, the judgement, to be president.  She believes she is entitled to the office.  Her campaign slogan is \"I\\'m with her.\"  You know what my response to that is? I\\'m with you: the American people.  She thinks it\\'s all about her.  I know it\\'s all about you – I know it\\'s all about making America Great Again for All Americans.  Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.  We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism – focusing on what\\'s good for America\\'s middle class – to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.  We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.  This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.  This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.  We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.  That\\'s what we mean by America First.  Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.  Our Founders understood this.  One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for \"the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]\" in America.[5]  Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:  \"The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.\"[6]  I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.  Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton\\'s disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organization.[7]  We\\'ve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.[8]  Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton\\'s time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.[9]  Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property – a crime which is continuing to this day.[10]  Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.  In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!  The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America\\'s expense.  She gets rich making you poor.  Here is a quote from the book: \"At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton…at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.\"  These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.[11]  She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.  Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas – and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.[12]  Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. She has even deleted this record of total support from her book – deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)[13]  But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn\\'t change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career – and it will be even worse than the Clintons\\' NAFTA deal.  I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.  We don\\'t make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.  It\\'s not just our economy that\\'s been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.  The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars – and unleashed ISIS across the world.  No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.  Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.  Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that\\'s right, when the phone rang at 3 o\\'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.  Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.[14]  Hillary Clinton\\'s State Department refused them all.  She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.  To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.[15]  Here is what one of the victim\\'s mothers had to say:  \"I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don\\'t want this person to be president.\"[16]  In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.  Libya was cooperating.  Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.  Syria was under control.  Iran was being choked by sanctions.  Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.  ISIS wasn\\'t even on the map.  Fast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed  to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.  Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.  Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.  Hillary Clinton\\'s support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen – while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.[17]  She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora\\'s box of radical Islam.  Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.[18]  ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.  ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality – and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.  In short, Hillary Clinton\\'s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.  It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.[19]  Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.[20]  But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn\\'t wait to rush us off to war in Libya.  She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.  In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:  \"She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve  in the office…from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true…Her leadership style – volcanic, impulsive…disdainful of the rules set for everyone else – hasn\\'t changed a bit.\"[21]  Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton\\'s foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.  In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that\\'s an increase over President Obama\\'s already very high number.[22]  Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth – with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.[23] [24]  Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.[25]  The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.[26]  I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.  Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.  Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.[27]  Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.  Here is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:  A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes. So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.[28] Hillary Clinton\\'s State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America\\'s uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.[29] Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access – even though he had no national security credentials.[30] Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State – plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary\\'s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. [31] Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.[32] Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.[33] To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.  Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments – perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China – putting all of America in danger.[34]  Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.[35]  While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.  So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.  This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.  We can\\'t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.  National security is also immigration security – and Hillary wants neither.  Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.  She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.[36]  The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They are the ones she will hurt the most.  Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.  She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.[37]  Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.  Here is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza\\'s letter:  \"Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms\\' way – an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.\"  Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.  For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.  Hillary\\'s Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can\\'t claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.  Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:  Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution. Hillary Clinton\\'s radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment. Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs Stand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many Cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas Lift restrictions on energy production Repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster. Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs. Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State. There is one common theme in all of these reforms.  It\\'s going to be America First.  This is why the stakes in November are so great.  On Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.  The voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don\\'t need or want another Clinton or Obama.  Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.  They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.  Hillary Clinton\\'s message is old and tired. Her message is that can\\'t change.  My message is that things have to change – and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it.  Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.  Then we started thinking small.  We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.  We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.  But that\\'s not who we are.  Come this November, we can bring America back – bigger and better, and stronger than ever.  We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth – the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.  Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment – we will bring it back all the way.  Massive new factories will come roaring into our country – breathing life and hope into our communities.  Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.  Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.  The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs. Hillary\\'s massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.  We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.  I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.  Our country is going to start working again.  People are going to start working again.  Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again – including parents in our inner cities.  Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country.  We are going to make America rich again.  We are going to make America safe again.  We are going to make America Great Again – and Great Again For EVERYONE.  ------------------------------------------------------  [1] (\"Sen.

Instead they have become part of the rigged system in Washington, D.C. that benefits only the insiders.  I believe their members will be voting for me in much larger numbers than for her.  Hillary Clinton and her husband have made hundreds of millions of dollars doing favors and selling access to Wall Street, special interests and oppressive foreign regimes. As Bernie Sanders said, \"Why, over her political career, has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?\" They own Hillary Clinton and she will do whatever they tell her to.  Bernie Sanders is also 100% correct when he says that Hillary Clinton \"vote[d] for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs.\" Hillary supported NAFTA and she supported the trade deal with China, Vietnam, South Korea – and if elected will implement the TPP she loves so much – guaranteed.  While Secretary of State,\\'Hillary Clinton racked up a $1 trillion trade deficit with China – all while China was funneling a small fortune to Hillary via speaking fees paid to Bill.  On immigration, Hillary Clinton sides with Wall Street too. Bernie Sanders correctly warned that open borders \"would substantially lower wages in this country,\" and yet Hillary has put forward a plan that would completely open America\\'s borders in her first 100 days in office.  On energy, Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the coal mines, block the Keystone pipeline, and destroy millions of good union jobs through executive action.  Her massive proposed increase in taxes and regulations will also send millions of jobs overseas.  Hillary Clinton will economically destroy poor communities, African-American and Hispanic workers on trade, immigration, crime, energy, taxes, regulation and everything else.  Finally, union workers have long believed in having an open and free society. Yet Hillary takes money from regimes that support the murder of gays and the enslavement of women while pushing to bring people into America who want to do the exact same thing to our people. I only want to bring people into our country who will love and support everyone.  Hillary Clinton is the enemy of working people and is the best friend Wall Street ever had. I will fight harder for American workers than anyone ever has, and I will fight for their right to elect leaders who will do the same.

TRUMP ADDRESSES TERRORISM, IMMIGRATION, AND NATIONAL SECURITY  Thank you for joining me today.  This was going to be a speech on Hillary Clinton and how bad a President, especially in these times of Radical Islamic Terrorism, she would be.  Even her former Secret Service Agent, who has seen her under pressure and in times of stress, has stated that she lacks the temperament and integrity to be president.  There will be plenty of opportunity to discuss these important issues at a later time, and I will deliver that speech soon.  But today there is only one thing to discuss: the growing threat of terrorism inside of our borders.  The attack on the Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, was the worst terrorist strike on our soil since September 11th, and the worst mass shooting in our country\\'s history.  So many people dead, so many people gravely injured, so much carnage, such a disgrace.  The horror is beyond description.  The families of these wonderful people are totally devastated. Likewise, our whole nation, and indeed the whole world, is devastated.  We express our deepest sympathies to the victims, the wounded, and their families.  We mourn, as one people, for our nation\\'s loss – and pledge our support to any and all who need it.  I would like to ask now that we all observe a moment of silence for the victims of the attack.  Our nation stands together in solidarity with the members of Orlando\\'s LGBT Community.  This is a very dark moment in America\\'s history.  A radical Islamic terrorist targeted the nightclub not only because he wanted to kill Americans, but in order to execute gay and lesbian citizens because of their sexual orientation.  It is a strike at the heart and soul of who we are as a nation.  It is an assault on the ability of free people to live their lives, love who they want and express their identity.  It is an attack on the right of every single American to live in peace and safety in their own country.  We need to respond to this attack on America as one united people – with force, purpose and determination.  But the current politically correct response cripples our ability to talk and think and act clearly.  If we don\\'t get tough, and we don\\'t get smart – and fast – we\\'re not going to have a country anymore -- there will be nothing left.  The killer, whose name I will not use, or ever say, was born to Afghan parents who immigrated to the United States. His father published support for the Afghan Taliban, a regime which murders those who don\\'t share its radical views. The father even said he was running for President of that country.  The bottom line is that the only reason the killer was in America in the first place was because we allowed his family to come here.  That is a fact, and it\\'s a fact we need to talk about.  We have a dysfunctional immigration system which does not permit us to know who we let into our country, and it does not permit us to protect our citizens.  We have an incompetent administration, and if I am not elected President, that will not change over the next four years -- but it must change, and it must change now.  With fifty people dead, and dozens more wounded, we cannot afford to talk around the issue anymore -- we have to address it head on.  I called for a ban after San Bernardino, and was met with great scorn and anger but now, many are saying I was right to do so -- and although the pause is temporary, we must find out what is going on. The ban will be lifted when we as a nation are in a position to properly and perfectly screen those people coming into our country.  The immigration laws of the United States give the President the power to suspend entry into the country of any class of persons that the President deems detrimental to the interests or security of the United States, as he deems appropriate.  I will use this power to protect the American people. When I am elected, I will suspend immigration from areas of the world when there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we understand how to end these threats.  After a full, impartial and long overdue security assessment, we will develop a responsible immigration policy that serves the interests and values of America.  We cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.  Many of the principles of Radical Islam are incompatible with Western values and institutions.  Radical Islam is anti-woman, anti-gay and anti-American.  I refuse to allow America to become a place where gay people, Christian people, and Jewish people, are the targets of persecution and intimidation by Radical Islamic preachers of hate and violence.  It\\'s not just a national security issue. It is a quality of life issue.  If we want to protect the quality of life for all Americans – women and children, gay and straight, Jews and Christians and all people – then we need to tell the truth about Radical Islam.  We need to tell the truth, also, about how Radical Islam is coming to our shores.  We are importing Radical Islamic Terrorism into the West through a failed immigration system -- and through an intelligence community held back by our president.  Even our own FBI Director has admitted that we cannot effectively check the backgrounds of the people we are letting into America.  All of the September 11th hijackers were issued visas.  Large numbers of Somali refugees in Minnesota have tried to join ISIS.  The Boston Bombers came here through political asylum.  The male shooter in San Bernardino – again, whose name I won\\'t mention -- was the child of immigrants from Pakistan, and he brought his wife – the other terrorist - from Saudi Arabia, through another one of our easily exploited visa programs.  Immigration from Afghanistan into the United States has increased nearly five-fold in just one year. According to Pew Research, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.  We admit many more from other countries in the region who share these same oppressive views.  If we want to remain a free and open society, then we have to control our borders.  Yet, Hillary Clinton – for months and despite so many attacks – repeatedly refused to even say the words \"radical Islam,\" until I challenged her yesterday to say the words or leave the race.  However, Hillary Clinton – who has been forced to say the words today after policies she supports have caused us so much damage – still has no clue what Radical Islam is, and won\\'t speak honestly about what it is.  She is in total denial, and her continuing reluctance to ever name the enemy broadcasts weakness across the world.  In fact, just a few weeks before the San Bernardino slaughter, Hillary Clinton explained her refusal to say the words Radical Islam. Here is what she said: \"Muslims are peaceful and tolerant people, and have nothing whatsoever to do with terrorism.\"  Hillary Clinton says the solution is to ban guns. They tried that in France, which has among the toughest gun laws in the world, and 130 were brutally murdered by Islamic terrorists in cold blood. Her plan is to disarm law-abiding Americans, abolishing the 2nd amendment, and leaving only the bad guys and terrorists with guns. She wants to take away Americans\\' guns, then admit the very people who want to slaughter us.  I will be meeting with the NRA, which has given me their earliest endorsement in a Presidential race, to discuss how to ensure Americans have the means to protect themselves in this age of terror.  The bottom line is that Hillary supports the policies that bring the threat of Radical Islam into America, and allow it to grow overseas.  In fact, Hillary Clinton\\'s catastrophic immigration plan will bring vastly more Radical Islamic immigration into this country, threatening not only our security but our way of life.  When it comes to Radical Islamic terrorism, ignorance is not bliss – it\\'s deadly.  The Obama Administration, with the support of Hillary Clinton and others, has also damaged our security by restraining our intelligence-gathering and failing to support law enforcement. They have put political correctness above common sense, above your safety, and above all else.  I refuse to be politically correct.  I will do the right thing--I want to straighten things out and to Make America Great Again.  The days of deadly ignorance will end, and they will end soon.  As President I will give our intelligence community, law enforcement and military the tools they need to prevent terrorist attacks.  We need an intelligence-gathering system second to none. That includes better cooperation between state, local and federal officials – and with our allies.  I will have an Attorney General, a Director of National Intelligence, and a Secretary of Defense who will know how to fight the war on Radical Islamic Terrorism – and who will have the support they require to get the job done.  We also must ensure the American people are provided the information they need to understand the threat.  The Senate Subcommittee on Immigration has already identified hundreds of immigrants charged with terrorist activities inside the United States since September 11th.  Nearly a year ago, the Senate Subcommittee asked President Obama\\'s Departments of Justice, State and Homeland Security to provide the immigration history of all terrorists inside the United States.  These Departments refused to comply.  President Obama must release the full and complete immigration histories of all individuals implicated in terrorist activity of any kind since 9/11.  The public has a right to know how these people got here.  We have to screen applicants to know whether they are affiliated with, or support, radical groups and beliefs.  We have to control the amount of future immigration into this country to prevent large pockets of radicalization from forming inside America.  Even a single individual can be devastating, just look at what happened in Orlando. Can you imagine large groups?  Truly, our President doesn\\'t know what he is doing. He has failed us, and failed us badly, and under his leadership, this situation will not get any better -- it will only get worse.  Each year, the United States permanently admits more than 100,000 immigrants from the Middle East, and many more from Muslim countries outside the Middle East. Our government has been admitting ever-growing numbers, year after year, without any effective plan for our security.  In fact, Clinton\\'s State Department was in charge of the admissions process for people applying to enter from overseas.  Having learned nothing from these attacks, she now plans to massively increase admissions without a screening plan, including a 500% increase in Syrian refugees.  This could be a better, bigger version of the legendary Trojan Horse.  We can\\'t let this happen.  Altogether, under the Clinton plan, you\\'d be admitting hundreds of thousands of refugees from the Middle East with no system to vet them, or to prevent the radicalization of their children.  The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why she believes immigration from these dangerous countries should be increased without any effective system to screen who we are bringing in.  The burden is on Hillary Clinton to tell us why we should admit anyone into our country who supports violence of any kind against gay and lesbian Americans.  The burden is also on Hillary Clinton to tell us how she will pay for it. Her plan will cost Americans hundreds of billions of dollars long-term.  Wouldn\\'t this money be better spent on rebuilding America for our current population, including the many poor people already living here?  We have to stop the tremendous flow of Syrian refugees into the United States – we don\\'t know who they are, they have no documentation, and we don\\'t know what they\\'re planning.  What I want is common sense. I want a mainstream immigration policy that promotes American values.  That is the choice I put before the American people: a mainstream immigration policy designed to benefit America, or Hillary Clinton\\'s radical immigration policy designed to benefit politically-correct special interests.  We\\'ve got to get smart, and tough, and vigilant, and we\\'ve got to do it now, because later is too late.  The media talks about \"homegrown,\" terrorism, but Islamic radicalism, and the networks that nurture it, are imports from overseas.  Yes, there are many radicalized people already inside our country as a result of the poor policies of the past. But the whole point is that it will be much, much easier to deal with our current problem if we don\\'t keep on bringing in people who add to the problem.  For instance, the controversial Mosque attended by the Boston Bombers had as its founder an immigrant from overseas charged in an assassination plot.  This shooter in Orlando was the child of an immigrant father who supported one of the most repressive regimes on Earth. Why would we admit people who support violent hatred?  Hillary Clinton can never claim to be a friend of the gay community as long as she continues to support immigration policies that bring Islamic extremists to our country who suppress women, gays and anyone who doesn\\'t share their views.  She can\\'t have it both ways. She can\\'t claim to be supportive of these communities while trying to increase the number of people coming in who want to oppress them.  How does this kind of immigration make our life better? How does this kind of immigration make our country better?  Why does Hillary Clinton want to bring people here—in vast numbers—who reject our values?  Ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community, Donald Trump with his actions, or Hillary Clinton with her words? Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country—they enslave women, and murder gays.  I don\\'t want them in our country.  Immigration is a privilege, and we should not let anyone into this country who doesn\\'t support our communities – all of our communities.  America has already admitted four times more immigrants than any country on earth, and we continue to admit millions more with no real checks or scrutiny.  Not surprisingly, wages for our workers haven\\'t budged in many years.  So whether it\\'s matter of national security, or financial security, we can\\'t afford to keep on going like this. We owe $19 trillion in debt, and no longer have options.  All our communities, from all backgrounds, are ready for some relief. This is not an act of offense against anyone; it is an act of defense.  I want us all to work together, including in partnership with our Muslim communities. But Muslim communities must cooperate with law enforcement and turn in the people who they know are bad – and they do know where they are.  I want to fix our schools, roads, bridges and job market. I want every American to succeed. Hillary Clinton wants to empty out the Treasury to bring people into the country that include individuals who preach hate against our own citizens.  I want to protect our citizens – all of our citizens.  The terrorist attack on the Pulse Night Club demands a full and complete investigation into every aspect of the assault.  In San Bernardino, as an example, people knew what was going on, but they used the excuse of racial profiling for not reporting it.  We need to know what the killer discussed with his relatives, parents, friends and associates.  We need to know if he was affiliated with any radical Mosques or radical activists and what, if any, is their immigration status.  We need to know if he travelled anywhere, and who he travelled with.  We need to make sure every single last person involved in this plan – including anyone who knew something but didn\\'t tell us – is brought to justice.  If it can be proven that somebody had information about any attack, and did not give this information to authorities, they must serve prison time .  America must do more – much more – to protect its citizens, especially people who are potential victims of crimes based on their backgrounds or sexual orientations.  It also means we must change our foreign policy.  The decision to overthrow the regime in Libya, then pushing for the overthrow of the regime in Syria, among other things, without plans for the day after, have created space for ISIS to expand and grow.  These actions, along with our disastrous Iran deal, have also reduced our ability to work in partnership with our Muslim allies in the region.  That is why our new goal must be to defeat Islamic terrorism, not nation-building.  For instance, the last major NATO mission was Hillary Clinton\\'s war in Libya. That mission helped unleash ISIS on a new continent.  I\\'ve said NATO needs to change its focus to stopping terrorism. Since I\\'ve raised that criticism, NATO has since announced a new initiative focused on just that.  America must unite the whole civilized world in the fight against Islamic terrorism, just like we did against communism in the Cold War.  We\\'ve tried it President Obama\\'s way. He gave the world his apology tour, we got ISIS, and many other problems, in return.  I\\'d like to conclude my remarks today by again expressing our solidarity with the people of Orlando who have come under attack.  When I am President, I pledge to protect and defend all Americans who live inside of our borders. Wherever they come from, wherever they were born, all Americans living here and following our laws will be protected.  America will be a tolerant and open society.  America will also be a safe society.  We will protect our borders at home.  We will defeat ISIS overseas.  We will ensure every parent can raise their children in peace and safety.  We will make America rich again.  We will make America safe again.  We will make American Great Again.

TRUMP STATEMENT REGARDING TRAGIC TERRORIST ATTACK IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA  Last night, our nation was attacked by a radical Islamic terrorist. It was the worst terrorist attack on our soil since 9/11, and the second of its kind in 6 months. My deepest sympathy and support goes out to the victims, the wounded, and their families.  In his remarks today, President Obama disgracefully refused to even say the words 'Radical Islam'. For that reason alone, he should step down. If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words 'Radical Islam' she should get out of this race for the Presidency.  If we do not get tough and smart real fast, we are not going to have a country anymore. Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen – and it is only going to get worse. I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack. We can't afford to be politically correct anymore.  The terrorist, Omar Mir Saddique Mateen, is the son of an immigrant from Afghanistan who openly published his support for the Afghanistani Taliban and even tried to run for President of Afghanistan. According to Pew, 99% of people in Afghanistan support oppressive Sharia Law.  We admit more than 100,000 lifetime migrants from the Middle East each year. Since 9/11, hundreds of migrants and their children have been implicated in terrorism in the United States.  Hillary Clinton wants to dramatically increase admissions from the Middle East, bringing in many hundreds of thousands during a first term – and we will have no way to screen them, pay for them, or prevent the second generation from radicalizing.  We need to protect all Americans, of all backgrounds and all beliefs, from Radical Islamic Terrorism - which has no place in an open and tolerant society. Radical Islam advocates hate for women, gays, Jews, Christians and all Americans. I am going to be a President for all Americans, and I am going to protect and defend all Americans. We are going to make America safe again and great again for everyone.  - Donald J.

I am friends with and employ thousands of people of Mexican and Hispanic descent. The American justice system relies on fair and impartial judges. All judges should be held to that standard. I do not feel that one\\'s heritage makes them incapable of being impartial, but, based on the rulings that I have received in the Trump University civil case, I feel justified in questioning whether I am receiving a fair trial.  Over the past few weeks, I have watched as the media has reported one inaccuracy after another concerning the ongoing litigation involving Trump University. There are several important facts the public should know and that the media has failed to report.  Throughout the litigation my attorneys have continually demonstrated that students who participated in Trump University were provided a substantive, valuable education based upon a curriculum developed by professors from Northwestern University, Columbia Business School, Stanford University and other respected institutions. And, the response from students was overwhelming. Over a five year period, more than 10,000 paying students filled out surveys giving the courses high marks and expressing their overwhelming satisfaction with Trump University\\'s programs. For example:  Former student Tarla Makaeff, the original plaintiff in the litigation, not only completed multiple surveys rating Trump University\\'s three-day seminar \"excellent\" in every category, but also praised Trump University\\'s mentorship program in a glowing 5 plus minute video testimonial. When asked \"how could Trump University help to meet [her] goals\", she simply stated \"[c]ontinue to offer great classes.\" Once the plaintiffs\\' lawyers realized how disastrous a witness she was, they asked to have her removed from the case. Over my lawyers\\' objections, the judge granted the plaintiffs\\' motion, but allowed the case to continue.  Art Cohen, a lead plaintiffs in the litigation, completed a survey in which he not only rated Trump University\\'s three-day seminar \"excellent\" in virtually every category, but went so far as to indicate that he would \"attend another Trump University seminar\" and even \"recommend Trump University seminars to a friend.\" When asked how Trump University could improve the seminar, Mr. Cohen\\'s only suggestion was to \"[h]ave lunch sandwiches brought in\" and make the lunch break 45 minutes.  Former student Bob Giullo, who has been critical of Trump University in numerous interviews and negative advertisements from my political opponents, also expressed his satisfaction, rating Trump University\\'s programs \"excellent\" in every category. When asked how Trump University could improve its programs, Mr. Giullo simply asked that students be provided \"more comfortable chairs.\"  Indeed, these are just a few of literally thousands of positive surveys, all of which can be viewed online at www.98percentapproval.com.  For those students who decided that Trump University\\'s programs were not for them, the company had a generous refund policy, offering a full refund to any student who asked for their money back within 3 days of signing up for a program or by the end of the first day of any multi-day program, whichever came later.  Normally, legal issues in a civil case would be heard in a neutral environment. However, given my unique circumstances as nominee of the Republican Party and the core issues of my campaign that focus on illegal immigration, jobs and unfair trade, I have concerns as to my ability to receive a fair trial.  I am fighting hard to bring jobs back to the United States. Many companies – like Ford, General Motors, Nabisco, Carrier – are moving production to Mexico. Drugs and illegal immigrants are also pouring across our border. This is bad for all Americans, regardless of their heritage.  Due to what I believe are unfair and mistaken rulings in this case and the Judge\\'s reported associations with certain professional organizations, questions were raised regarding the Obama appointed Judge\\'s impartiality. It is a fair question. I hope it is not the case.  While this lawsuit should have been dismissed, it is now scheduled for trial in November. I do not intend to comment on this matter any further. With all of the thousands of people who have given the courses such high marks and accolades, we will win this case!  Donald J.

TRUMP RESPONSE TO CRUZ AND KASICH CAMPAIGNS  It is sad that two grown politicians have to collude against one person who has only been a politician for ten months in order to try and stop that person from getting the Republican nomination.  Senator Cruz has done very poorly and after his New York performance, which was a total disaster, he is in free fall and as everyone has seen, he does not react well under pressure. Also, approximately 80% of the Republican Party is against him. Governor Kasich, who has only won 1 state out of 41, in other words, he is 1 for 41 and he is not even doing as well as other candidates who could have stubbornly stayed in the race like him but chose not to do so. Marco Rubio, as an example, has more delegates than Kasich and yet suspended his campaign one month ago. Others, likewise, have done much better than Kasich, who would get slaughtered by Hillary Clinton once the negative ads against him begin. 85% of Republican voters are against Kasich.  Collusion is often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive. They are mathematically dead and this act only shows, as puppets of donors and special interests, how truly weak they and their campaigns are. I have brought millions of voters into the Republican primary system and have received many millions of votes more than Cruz or Kasich. Additionally, I am far ahead of both candidates with delegates and would be receiving in excess of 60% of the vote except for the fact that there were so many candidates running against me.  Because of me, everyone now sees that the Republican primary system is totally rigged. When two candidates who have no path to victory get together to stop a candidate who is expanding the party by millions of voters, (all of whom will drop out if I am not in the race) it is yet another example of everything that is wrong in Washington and our political system. This horrible act of desperation, from two campaigns who have totally failed, makes me even more determined, for the good of the Republican Party and our country, to prevail!', 'link_name': '', 'status_type': 'status', 'status_link': '', 'status_published': '4/25/2016 6:00:49', 'num_reactions': '128693', 'num_comments': '17279', 'num_shares': '21861', 'num_likes': '119276', 'num_loves': '6713', 'num_wows': '423', 'num_hahas': '1360', 'num_sads': '164', 'num_angrys': '757'}, {'status_id': '153080620724_10156966372235725', 'status_message': 'Unbelievable - Hagerstown, Maryland!

DONALD J. TRUMP ENDORSED BY SENATOR JEFF SESSIONS stars   Senator Sessions Joined Mr. Trump in Madison, Alabama to Endorse the Republican Frontrunner  (New York, NY) February 28th, 2016 – Today Donald J. Trump received the endorsement of Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions. Senator Sessions is widely recognized as the nation\\'s most highly respected official on the issue of illegal immigration.   Mr. Trump stated, \"I am deeply honored to have the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions, leader of congressional conservatives. He has been called the Senate\\'s indispensable man and the gold standard. He led the fight against the Gang of Eight, against Obama\\'s trade deal, against Obama\\'s judges, and for American sovereignty. He has stood up to special interests as few have. There is no more respected man in Congress and we are closely aligned on many issues, including trade and illegal immigration, and I am proud to consider Jeff Sessions an advisor, friend and ally.\"   Mr. Trump and Senator Sessions surprised the massive crowd at the frontrunner\\'s Alabama rally just days before Super Tuesday Primary contest.   Senator Sessions added, \"I am thrilled today to offer my endorsement of Donald J. Trump for President. This election is our last chance to save U.S. sovereignty and to end the domination of the political establishment over the interests of working Americans. Trump alone has rejected the donor class, defending America\\'s jobs and wages from open borders, uncontrolled immigration and the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership that will cede U.S. authority to foreign powers. Trump\\'s trade and immigration plans will revitalize our shrinking middle class, keeping jobs and wealth and income inside the United States of America. Trump understands that a nation must always place the interests of its own people first.\"   Senator Sessions continued, \"We are nearing fast the point of no return. The people are hurting. Their wages are declining. Their schools are overburdened. Their hospitals are stretched past the breaking point. Crime is up, and community confidence is down. Americans of all backgrounds and ethnicities, immigrant and US-born, are crying out for leadership that puts their needs first, that takes care of those living and dreaming here today, leadership that understands that there is no constituency other than the American constituency.

I've never said I'm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I'm not.

I said it, it was wrong, and I apologize.  I've travelled the country talking about change for America. But my travels have also changed me.  I've spent time with grieving mothers who've lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I've been humbled by the faith they've placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down. Let's be honest.  We're living in the real world.  This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today.  We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were 8 years ago and Washington is broken. Hillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground.  I've said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days.

Thank you for your amazing support. LETS WIN this November - get out and VOTE!  **REMARKS AS PREPARED FOR DELIVERY**  Thank you. It is always so great to be back in New Hampshire, the state where we had our first victory in this incredible journey.  I\\'ve come to know and love the people of New Hampshire. You are strong, independent and you are free.  We are all going to work very hard together over the next 40 days, and we are going to win this state, we are going to win the White House.  We are going to take on the special interests, the lobbyists, and the corrupt corporate media that have rigged the system against everyday Americans.  We are going to create millions of new jobs for our people, trillions in new wealth for our communities, and rising wages for every working American.  We are going to create a new government that serves you, your family, and your country.  We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.  Hillary Clinton is an insider fighting only for herself and for her donors.  I am an outsider fighting for you.  Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple but very important phrase: Follow The Money.  The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow the money.  The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow the money.  The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow the money.  The special interests who want open borders are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Again, just follow the money.  In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.  She and Bill were paid $150 million for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office.  The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.  Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.  Favors and access were granted to those who wrote checks.  She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale – and if she ever got the chance, she\\'d put the Oval Office up for sale too.  She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. We\\'re going to call them the FBI Immunity 5. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.  She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country.  The American people have had it with years, decades, of Clinton Corruption and scandals. They are tired of the lies, they are tired of the trivial politics, they are tired of being talked down to, looked down upon, and treated like second class citizens.  The Clintons are the sordid past.  We are the bright future.  While our campaign outlines big changes and bold solutions to make your life better, the Clinton campaign focuses only on small and petty distractions.  This will be the year the American people say: Enough is enough.  Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don\\'t think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she\\'ll do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does, and that will never change. Many of them will never forget her calling young African-American men \"super-predators.\"  Same thing goes for Hispanic voters – they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.  A Trump Administration will bring prosperity to all of our people.  My economic agenda can be summed up with three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.  We are going to pass the biggest tax cut since Ronald Reagan, and we are going to lower the business rate from 35% to 15% -- making America into a magnet for new jobs.  Every wasteful and unnecessary regulation will be eliminated, along with every illegal executive order.  We will unleash the power of American energy – we are sitting on $50 trillion dollars in untapped energy reserves, and we are going to put that wealth into the pockets of the American people.  Common core will be ended, and disadvantaged children will be allowed to attend the school of their choice.  The catastrophe known as Obamacare will be repealed and replaced.  And the disastrous trade deals, like NAFTA, that have caused so much pain in New Hampshire, will be renegotiated.  NAFTA was signed by Bill Clinton, and supported by Hillary Clinton – and your state has lost 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since it was approved. You\\'ve lost 1 in 4 since China entered the World Trade Organization – another Bill and Hillary-backed deal.  Hillary Clinton has been on the wrong side of every major trade deal in her career and, if she gets the chance, she would approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership – which would destroy manufacturing in this state.  Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for the special interests trying to strip this country of its wealth, its jobs, and its status as a sovereign nation. She is a globalist who has made a career taking jobs from our country and giving them to other countries.  I am not running to be President of the World. I am running to be President of the United States of America.  From now on, it\\'s going to be America First.  Have you ever wondered why it is that all things that the American people want never seem to happen?  Think about it. For how many years have the American people asked for our tax code to be fixed? Or for our infrastructure to be repaired? Or for the waste to be removed from the budget? For how many years have voters pleaded for secure borders, fair trade deals, and quality schools that serve parents and students?  All the things you\\'ve ever wanted for your country have been denied.  The reason for this is simple. It\\'s because the financial interests who control our politics and our media don\\'t want these changes to happen.  These special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative.  She\\'s been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family.  She\\'s there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.  Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors – we\\'re taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.  That includes keeping your family safe.  New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America\\'s large cities, and that it\\'s the largest single-year increase in 45 years.  More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.  The failed politicians and the arrogant media don\\'t want me to talk about the crime and the violence that is happening in our country. They just want me to go along with the status quo.  Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me, and trying to silence all of us.  We will never back down from fighting to save American lives.  That also means keeping our nation safe from Radical Islamic Terrorism. Hillary Clinton can\\'t even say the words.  We are also going to keep our country safe from drugs. New Hampshire has suffered so greatly from the heroin crisis and the drugs pouring across our border. The rate of heroin overdoses has nearly quadrupled – once again, our politicians have tragically failed this country and its people.  I am going to stop the drugs from pouring across our border – that is a promise.  The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.  Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We\\'re trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.  They\\'re all part of the same corrupt political establishment. And they nod along when Hillary Clinton slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable.  I call you hardworking American Patriots and together we are going to save this country.  Together, we can accomplish anything we want.  But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th.  You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country. To beat the system, you have to lift your voice, pound the pavement, and get out the vote. Visit our website to find out how you can help.  You have 40 days until the election. You have 40 days to make every dream you ever dreamed for your country come true.  Do Not Let This Chance Slip Away.  You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman and child in this nation.  The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.  On November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than ever before.  Here is just some of the great things that will happen for your country:  We are going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare; make childcare more affordable; bring back our manufacturing jobs; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2ndamendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.  We will rebuild our roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, airports, schools and hospitals.  American cars will travel the roads, American planes will soar in the skies, and American ships will patrol the seas.  American steel will send new skyscrapers into the clouds.  American hands will rebuild this nation – and American energy, harvested from American sources, will power this nation. American workers will be hired to do the job.  We will put new American steel into the spine of this country.  I will fight for every neglected part of this nation – and I will fight to bring us all together as Americans.  Imagine what our country could accomplish if we started working together as One People, under One God, saluting One American Flag.  It is time to break with the bitter failures of the past, and to embrace a new, inclusive and prosperous American future.  Once more, we will have a government of, by and for the people.  We Will Make America Wealthy Again.  We Will Make America Strong Again.  We Will Make America Safe Again.  And We Will Make America Great Again.

It\\'s so great to be in Wisconsin tonight.  A recent Reuters poll had us tied in Wisconsin, and we were just in Iowa where we are up by 10 in the Reuters poll – and a new post-debate Google poll has us leading Hillary Clinton by 2 points nationwide, and that\\'s despite the fact that they were suppressing bad news about Hillary Clinton.  On November 8th, we are going to win this state and we are going to win the White House.  It\\'s going to be a victory for YOU, the American people.  We are going to end the Clinton Corruption and restore dignity and honesty to government service.  Hillary Clinton is an insider who fights only for her donors and for herself.  I am an outsider fighting for you.  One of the first things we are going to do is restore law and order to this country. Our good friend, Sheriff Clarke, is here with us tonight.  New FBI statistics shows that homicide rose 15% last year in America\\'s large cities, and that it\\'s the largest single-year increase in 45 years.  More than 3,000 people have been shot in Chicago since January.  Homicides are up nearly 50% in Washington D.C. and more than 60% in Baltimore.  Across the entire nation, for cities of all sizes, small and large, the homicide rates rose by more than 10% last year.  This is a national crisis.  Yet, my opponent, Hillary Clinton, continues to attack the police. First, she calls our supporters – many of them cops, soldiers and firefighters – deplorable and irredeemable.  Then, in our debate this week, she accusses the entire country, including all of law enforcement, of \"implicit bias,\" – essentially suggesting that everyone, including our police, are basically racist and prejudiced.  Maybe Hillary Clinton should confine her comments to herself. After all, she is the one who described young African-American men as \"super-predators.\"  How can Hillary Clinton try to lead this country when she has such a low opinion of its citizens?  How can she lead a country when she thinks America is full of racists, deplorables and irredeemables?  By smearing tens of millions of hardworking, decent Americans she has rendered herself unfit to be President.  She has nothing but hostility in her heart for hardworking Americans, of all backgrounds, who just want to live in safety, security and peace.  The police officers she attacks are the same people – of all colors and nationalities – who race into danger every day to save the lives of complete strangers.  Those fostering the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in this country share directly in the blame for the violence and chaos that threatens our most vulnerable citizens.  My agenda of reducing crime will benefit all Americans, but those who will benefit most are African-American and Hispanic-American citizens living in high crime communities. We are going to save thousands of lives.  The special interests, the arrogant media, and the political insiders, don\\'t want me to talk about the crime that is happening in our country and in our inner cities. They don\\'t want you to know about the hurt and pain that is happening to our fellow citizens. They want me to just go along with the same failed policies that have caused so much needless suffering and so much preventable heartache.  Well, I have news for the people trying to silence me and trying to silence all of us.  I will never back down from fighting to save American lives.  I will never back down from fighting to save America\\'s inner cities.  The only people Hillary Clinton ever fights for are the special interests who write her checks. Follow The Money.  Hillary Clinton has been a disaster for so many communities, but especially for African-American communities. I don\\'t think African-Americans are going to come out and vote for Clinton – they are too smart, and they know they are being used. They also know that she\\'ll do nothing for them once the election is over – she never does, and that will never change.  Same thing goes for Hispanic voters – they are tired of being used by people like Hillary Clinton, that have no intention of doing anything for them once the election is over.  58% of African-American youth don\\'t have jobs. There is another shooting in Chicago every 2 hours. 45% of African-American children under the age of six are living in poverty.  The inner cities have been left behind.  Crime is through the roof, public education is a disaster, there are no jobs, it\\'s dangerous to walk down the street with your child. To the African-American community, I say: what do you have to lose? Vote for Donald Trump, I will fix it.  I will fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before.  Everything you need to know about Hillary Clinton can be understood with this simple phrase: Follow The Money.  The large corporations who support terrible trade deals that offshore jobs – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow The Money.  The Wall Street investors who have rigged the regulations against the middle class – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow The Money.  The wealthy donors who want to shut down American energy – they are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow The Money.  The special interests who want open borders, for cheap labor, are donating to Hillary Clinton.  Follow The Money.  She and her financial backers will say anything, do anything, lie about anything to keep their grip on power – to keep their control over this country.  In her campaign for President, Hillary Clinton has received $100 million dollars in contributions from Wall Street and the hedge funds.  She received $4.1 million in speaking fees from financial firms.  She and Bill received a total of $150 million in speaking fees from special interests since Bill left office. It\\'s all part of the rigged system being run at your expense.  The same groups paying Bill and Hillary for their speeches were lobbying the federal government.  Twenty-two groups paying Bill Clinton for speeches lobbied the State Department while Hillary was Secretary of State.  And don\\'t forget the Clinton contributors were appointed to advisory boards by Secretary Clinton – or all the favors and access granted to those who provided funds. She even gave up 20% of America\\'s uranium supply to Russia.  She put the office of Secretary of State up for sale – and if she ever got the chance, she\\'d put the Oval Office up for sale too.  She deleted and bleached 33,000 emails after a Congressional subpoena. 13 phones missing, several destroyed with a hammer. Her staffers taking the fifth amendment, and her ringleaders getting immunity deals. Foreign enemies with easy access to hack her server. Lies to Congress, under oath, about turning over her work-related emails.  The American people have had it with years, decades, of the Clintons\\' scandals and corruption.

I am running to be President of the United States of America.  From now on, it\\'s going to be America First.  These special interests control Hillary Clinton. She is their chosen representative. You can disregard everything she says and just remember this phrase: Follow The Money. She\\'s there for only one reason, to protect her donors and collect their money.  Look at her career. She\\'s been there for 30 years, and has never done anything for you and your family. She\\'s failed at everything. She failed in Iraq, in Libya, in Syria, in Iran, in Egypt. She failed on ISIS – in fact, she unleashed ISIS onto the world.  She failed upstate New York – promising 200,000 jobs, but instead the jobs left. All she did was name a post office and a highway.  She failed the inner cities.  She\\'s failed women and children.  The only people Hillary Clinton has ever delivered for are her donors.  Our campaign is taking on big business, big media and big donors – we\\'re taking them on for YOU. So you can have the future you want.  I\\'m not owned or controlled by anyone – my loyalty is to you, and no one else. I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.  My economic agenda can be summed up in three very beautiful words: jobs, jobs, jobs.  We will cut your taxes, reduce regulations, negotiate great trade deals, unleash American energy and we are going to repeal and replace Obamacare.  We are also going to end common core and offer school choice to every disadvantaged child – including every poor Hispanic and African-American child in America. We will put every American kid on the ladder of American success: a great education, and a great job.  The people getting rich off the rigged system are the people throwing their money at Hillary Clinton.  Follow the Money.  Our campaign is about breaking-up the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C. We\\'re trying to disrupt the collusion between the wealthy donors, the large corporations, and the media executives.  They\\'re all part of the same rigged political establishment. They go to the same restaurants, they attend the same conferences, they have the same friends and connections. And they are all in for a big day of reckoning on November 8th.  Government will start working for you again. Fixing things is what I do. Just look at my projects in New York, and around the world, where I revitalized neighborhoods and lifted up skylines.  That\\'s what I want to do for our country – I want to go into every neighborhood and unlock their potential for all of our people.  Together, we can accomplish anything we want.  But that means you need to show up and vote on November 8th – and it means you need to start voting early. Early voting is already underway.  You have to knock on doors. You have to pick up that phone. You have to campaign on the streets. Spread the love that we have in this room to the people of our country.

The arrogance of Washington, D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter.  This November 8th, we are going to show the whole world that America is Back – Bigger and Better and Stronger than Ever Before.  Here is just some of what will happen starting in January of 2017:  I am going to lower your taxes; eliminate every unnecessary regulation; repeal and replace Obamacare; unleash American energy; end illegal immigration; keep Radical Islamic terrorists out of our country; save the 2nd amendment; support the men and women of law enforcement; and appoint Justices to the Supreme Court who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States.

Thank you. I want to applaud my daughter, Ivanka, for her work and leadership on the issues facing working moms in our country. She has been deeply invested in this since long before the campaign began, and I am so grateful for her work and efforts on this proposal which I will be outlining today.  I want to also take a moment to recognize Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and a mother of three small children, who has been such a leader on these issues. We are also joined tonight by some amazing members of Congress in our audience: Congresswoman Blackburn, Lummis, Black, and Ellmers.  Our campaign is about ideas. We're about solutions. I've travelled all over the country in recent weeks offering detailed plans to make life better for you and your family.  I've outlined detailed proposals for providing school choice, reforming our tax and regulatory code, lifting restrictions on American energy, rebuilding our military, changing our foreign policy, fixing our immigration policy, and keeping our country safe.  Right now, our politicians have locked our country into endless fights about small and petty things. I'm asking the nation to lift our sights, and to imagine what we can accomplish if we work together, trust each other, and put the needs of our own citizens first.  We must break our ties with the failed and bitter politics of the past and pursue a future where every American is honored and respected.  We have to reject the arrogance of Washington D.C. that looks down on everyday hardworking people. Too often those who have power have disdain for the views, beliefs and attitudes of those who don't have political power.  Those in leadership must put themselves in the shoes of the laid-off factory worker, the family worried about security, or the mom struggling to afford childcare.  That means we need working mothers to be fairly compensated for their work, and to have access to affordable, quality child care for their kids. We want higher pay, better wages, and a growing economy for everyone. These solutions must update laws passed more than half a century ago when most women were still not in the labor force. Today, nearly 2 in 3 mothers with young children have jobs.  For many families in our country, childcare is now the single largest expense – even more than housing. Yet, very little meaningful policy work has been done in this area – and my opponent has no childcare plan.  Many Americans are just one crisis away from disaster – a sick kid, a lost job, a damaged home. There is no financial security. But that will all change under our pro-family, pro-child, pro-worker plans I am outlining tonight. Before going any further, I want everyone watching on TV right now to go to DonaldJTrump.com to read the full plan.  The first part of my childcare plan allows every parent or family in America – including adoptive parents and foster parent guardians – to deduct their childcare expenses from their income taxes.  They will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care for their state, from birth through the age of 13. Because of the way the benefit is capped and structured, our plan will bring relief to working and middle class families. The deduction also applies to elder care, capped at a $5,000-dollar deduction per year.  Importantly, our policy also supports mothers who choose to stay at home, and honors and recognizes their incredible contributions to their families and to our society. Families with a stay-at-home parent will be able to fully deduct the average cost of child care from their taxes.  For low-income individuals who have no net income tax liability, we will offer an expanded Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) in the form of a childcare rebate. Working parents can get an expanded EITC benefit that equals up to half of their total payroll tax – a major relief for low-income parents. This translates to as much as an extra $1,200 dollars in EITC benefits for working families.  Next, our plan allows every parent in America to open up a Dependent Care Savings Account. Families can contribute up to $2,000 dollars a year to these accounts completely tax-free. Crucially, unlike the flexible spending accounts that exist today, these accounts will be available to all Americans – you won't have to depend on your employer to provide them. Immediate family and employers can also contribute to a dependent account, each of which is designated for a specific child, including an unborn child.  The money that is put into these accounts can also be spent not only on child care, but also child enrichment activities. Additionally, the funds in these accounts do not expire at the end of the year – they don't revert to employers or to the Treasury. Instead, the funds rollover – so while only $2,000 dollars can be contributed each year, unspent sums can accumulate and create substantial savings.  These savings can then be used by parents to help give their kids school choice, and will thus contribute to the school choice reforms I outlined last week.  The funds will remain in the account until the age of 18. Whatever still remains at that time can be used to help offset the costs of higher education.  For low-income individuals, the federal government will provide matching funds – if parents contribute $1,000 dollars, the federal government will provide a $500 dollars match. To help low-income families reach these targets and save money, we will put a box on federal income tax forms allowing these parents to have their Earned Income Tax Credit funds directly deposited into their Dependent Care Savings Accounts.  These Dependent Care Savings Accounts can also be set-up to provide care for elderly dependents.  Our plan also includes much needed regulatory reform to incentivize private sector solutions. The new funds offered by our plan will create a new market for innovative childcare solutions.  But to make sure these solutions are available, especially in low-income and rural communities, we must reduce regulations that favor large institutional care facilities. We will allow the states to make the decisions that are right for them.  In this era of the sharing economy, we want parents to be able to access lower-cost, competitive and innovative solutions at the click of a button – including services like nanny-sharing. Our plan would also cover care provided by relatives and grandparents. Our plan includes incentives for more employers to offer on-site childcare as well.   This can often be a good solution for many working parents, and can save them up to 30 minutes of commute time. Currently, only 7% of employers provide these services. Our plan will expand tax deductions for employers, allow companies to pool resources to provide shared childcare services, and remove needless requirements that have prevented employers from using the credit.  Finally, our plan offers a crucial safety net for working mothers whose employers do not provide paid maternity leave. This solution will receive strong bipartisan support, and will be completely self-financing. By recapturing fraud and improper payments in the unemployment insurance program, we can provide 6 weeks of paid-maternity leave to any mother with a newborn child whose employer does not provide the benefit. This maternity leave will be paid straight out of the unemployment insurance fund and, again, this safety net will be completely paid-for through savings within the program.  There are more reforms and solutions in our childcare plan, and you can review them all on the website.  On Thursday, I will outline my full economic plan, which is completely paid for through economic growth and proposed federal budget savings. Together, our tax, trade, regulatory, and energy policies will add trillions in new deficit-lowering growth.  These are the kinds of solutions I want to bring to the White House as your President. It's time to free ourselves from the baskets that politicians try to put us in, and instead to work together – not as Republicans or Democrats – but as Americans, to achieve real, positive results for the American people.  While my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you, hard-working American Patriots who love your country, love your families, and want a better future for all Americans.  It's time to end the rule of special interests, and to begin the rule of the American people. It's time to stop fighting over the smallest words, and to start dreaming about the great adventures that lie ahead.  It is time to Believe In America.  Together, We Will Make Our Country Strong Again.  We Will Make Our Country Prosperous Again.  And Will Make Our Country Great Again For Everyone!

TRUMP ADDRESSES CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES  It is so great to be back in New Hampshire. I have developed such deep affection for this state and for its people. My first victory took place here.  Over the next 74 days, we are all going to work very hard together to win this state – just like we did in the primaries – and to win the White House for the American people.  Our victory is going to be a victory for the great majority of Americans whose voice has not been heard.  Year after year, we live under a Washington regime that ignores your demands, rejects your cries for help, and that always puts your needs last.  The real divide in this election is not between left and right, but between everyday working people and a corrupt political establishment that works only for itself.  This election is a chance for the great majority of decent citizens to end the rule of a small group of special interests and to return that power to the voters.  Hillary Clinton believes only in government of, by and for the powerful.  I am promising government of, by and for the people.  In this fight, we are taking on some very entrenched and well-financed interests. These are the same people who pay Hillary $10,000 dollars a minute for a speech. These special interests are the same people who own the newspapers that cover-up her crimes. These are the Wall Street firms who paid Hillary Clinton a quarter of a million dollars each time she delivered her secret remarks. They are the same people who paid Bill and Hillary Clinton over $150 million dollars for speeches since Bill left the Oval Office – and who donated countless millions more to the Clinton Foundation.  But, you have the power, with your vote, to defeat those special interests and put the people back in charge once more.  This has been a historic week in American politics.  The voters have always known that our leadership in Washington D.C. is corrupt, and that the system is very badly rigged.  But this week the curtain was lifted. The corruption was revealed for all to see. The veil was pulled back on a vast criminal enterprise run out of the State Department by Hillary Clinton.  As the Associated Press documented, more than half of the meetings Hillary Clinton took as Secretary of State with people outside government were Foundation donors.  Hillary Clinton\\'s chief of staff received more messages from the Clinton Foundation\\'s Chief Operating Officer than just about anyone else.  85 donors alone that she met with as Secretary gave the Foundation $156 million dollars.  On top of that, Bill Clinton\\'s total speaking fees rose 44% while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State – often raking in money from people who had business or matters before the State Department.  As I said weeks ago, Hillary Clinton ran the State Department like a personal hedge fund.  It is hard to tell where the Clinton Foundation ended, and where the State Department began.  Access and favors were sold for cash. It\\'s called Pay-For-Play.  Over and over and over, people who donated to the Clinton Foundation – or who gave money to Bill Clinton – got favorable treatment from Hillary Clinton\\'s State Department.  The examples are too many to name here in full, and I\\'ve gone over some in recent days. They include the deal to sell 20% of U.S. Uranium to Russia, or the favorable treatment for UBS. It includes the exemption of Telecom Giant Ericsson from government sanctions. It includes efforts to put a Foundation donor – with no national security experience – onto a highly-sensitive national security panel with access to top secret information. It includes Foundation donors getting lucrative contracts in Haiti – all while the people of Haiti suffered horribly.  But these examples are only the tip of the Clinton Corruption iceberg.  Hillary Clinton\\'s actions constitute all of the elements of a major criminal enterprise.  She created a private illegal email server in order to hide her corrupt dealings. She did so knowing full well it would put American lives at risk by making classified information highly vulnerable to foreign hacking. But, she didn\\'t care – as long as it helped her get away with her crime, no risk to America was too great.  Then, to further cover-up her crime, she deleted 33,000 emails to keep them out of the hands of authorities and the American public.  As a further element of the criminal cover-up, she claimed under penalty of perjury that she turned over all of her work related emails. We now know this to be one more massive Clinton lie. The FBI found thousands of work-related emails she failed to turn over, including the new discovery this week of 15,000 more work-related emails she failed to disclose.  What is being uncovered now is one of the most shocking scandals in American political history.  A Secretary of State sold her office to corporations and foreign governments, betraying the public trust – putting innocent lives in danger – and then she went to great lengths to hide, delete, destroy and lie about the evidence. Just like her lie that she never sent any material marked classified.  Lie after lie after lie.  This is the corruption we expect to see in a Third World country – but not in America.  Just imagine the damage to our security, to our integrity, to our standing in the world, if Hillary Clinton is allowed to sell the Oval Office the same way she sold her office as Secretary of State.  We cannot let this happen.  We must vote on November 8th to keep the American government from being sold to the highest bidder.  Vote to save your country. Vote to protect your family. Vote for honesty, integrity and accountability.  Now, as all of these revelations have been discovered this week, Hillary Clinton has been in hiding.  But today, she emerges. However, she is emerging not to take responsibility for her unethical and criminal conduct, but instead to make one of the most brazen attempts at distraction in the history of politics.  Now, I have not seen Hillary Clinton\\'s remarks. And, in a sense, I don\\'t want to dignify them by dwelling on them too much, but a response is required for the sake of all decent voters she is trying to smear.  The news reports are that Hillary Clinton is going to try to accuse this campaign, and the millions of decent Americans who support this campaign, of being racists.  It\\'s the oldest play in the Democratic playbook.  When Democratic policies fail, they are left with only this one tired argument. It\\'s the last refuge of the discredited politician.  They keep going back to this same well, but the well has run dry.  This is the year that the people who have been betrayed by Democratic policies, including millions of African-American and Hispanic-American citizens, reject the politicians who have failed them and vote for change.  As I\\'ve discussed for many days now, Democratic politicians have run nearly every inner city in America for fifty or sixty years or more. Their policies have produced only more poverty, joblessness, and failing schools.  Every policy Hillary Clinton supports is a policy that has failed and betrayed communities of color in this country. But she just doesn\\'t care – she\\'s too busy raking in cash from the people rigging the system.  Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty. 58% of African-American youth are not working. More than 2,700 people have been shot in Chicago this year alone.  These are the consequences of Hillary Clinton\\'s policies. She has brought nothing but pain and heartache to our inner cities.  On top of that, she wants to raise taxes on African-American owned businesses to as much as nearly 50 percent. We should be helping these businesses to grow and expand – but Hillary Clinton is trying to shut them down.  She opposes school choice.  She supports open borders that violate the civil rights of African-Americans by giving their jobs to people here unlawfully.  She supports trade policies that have closed factories in African-American communities and put millions of African-Americans out of work.  She supports radical regulations that put Americans out of work and raise the price of their energy bills.  She supports policies on crime that make communities less safe, and that make it harder to raise your children in security and peace.  I believe every single parent in this country – and especially in the inner cities – has the right to raise their kids in safety. This is one of the great civil rights issues of our time.  But Hillary Clinton doesn\\'t want to talk about any of this. She can\\'t defend her record. She doesn\\'t have one single proposal that hasn\\'t been tried and failed. She doesn\\'t have one idea that does anything but destroy jobs for African-American and Hispanic citizens – and all citizens – in our country.  So what does she do when she can\\'t defend her record?  She lies, she smears, she paints decent Americans as racists. She bullies voters, who only want a better future, and tries to intimidate them out of voting for change.  As I discussed yesterday, these are the same tactics the establishment powers used to try to scare the British people out of voting for change too.  It didn\\'t work there. It won\\'t work here.  The American people are ready to vote for freedom, opportunity and justice. They are ready to take back control of their own futures.  It\\'s time the Clintons were held accountable for their inappropriate conduct. According to the book Game Change, Bill Clinton said about President Barack Obama that \"a few years ago this guy would have been getting us coffee.\" And we\\'ve all seen the cringe-worthy comments from Hillary Clinton, which I won\\'t get into here but we all know what they are.  Here\\'s the important point though that I want to get across today. Hillary Clinton isn\\'t just attacking me, she\\'s attacking all the people who support our movement.  We can\\'t let that stand. Voters are used to the old game where failed politicians like Hillary Clinton falsely smear Republicans with charges of racism. Republicans then back down. Democrats then continue to push policies that are devastating to communities of color.  We must break this corrupt cycle. And we are going to break it beginning today.  So let me make some very clear statements before this whole country.  First, on the border. People who want their laws enforced and respected, and who want their border secured, are not racists. They are patriotic Americans of all backgrounds who want their jobs protected and their country kept safe. I will never apologize for pledging to enforce and uphold every single law of the United States, and to make my immigration priority defending and protecting American citizens above every other single consideration. We will end illegal immigration and we will restore the Constitutional rule of law.  Next, on national security. People who speak out against Radical Islam, and who warn about refugees, are not Islamophobes. They are decent American citizens who want to uphold our values as a tolerant society, and who want to keep the terrorists out of our country. If the choice is between saving lives – or appeasing politically-correct censors in Washington D.C., that is the easiest choice I will ever have to make. I will always choose saving American lives.  Now, on crime. People who support the police, and who want crime reduced, are not prejudiced. They are concerned and loving citizens whose hearts break every time an innocent child is lost to preventable violence. There is no compassion in tolerating crime, and poisonous drug dealing, and the killings in our streets. I will work to dismantle the criminal gangs and cartels and to liberate our poorest citizens from crime and violence and poverty and fear.  To Hillary Clinton, and to her donors and advisors, pushing her to spread her smears and her lies about decent people, I have three words. I want you to hear these words, and remember these words: Shame On You.  When you are like the Clintons, getting $69 million dollars in political contributions from Wall Street and Big Banks, it is easy to look down on the so-called little people. It\\'s easy to ignore the devastation caused by our open borders when you spend all your time with wealthy donors and Hollywood celebrities. It is easy to ignore the heartfelt concerns of communities about Radical Islam entering our country, when you spend your time hanging out with foreign dictators in their lavish palaces. And it is easy, no doubt, for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to the ravages of crime, when she has her own personal armed security force.  This is how the system is rigged.  For decades, the American people have demanded that their immigration laws be enforced and that their jobs be protected from out-of-control immigration. But the special interests, who only want cheap labor, have stopped it from happening.  For years, the American people have worried about letting Radical Islam spread within our shores, but the elites – who only want to raise more money from global corporations – ignore the concerns of the American voters.  For fifty years, people living in our inner cities have suffered under a failed policy regime. But the Democratic politicians – who only want to please media executives and Wall Street donors – do nothing but expand the hurt and the suffering.  It is time for a new day to dawn in America.  On November 8th, we will end the rule of special interests – and we will begin the rule of the people.  I am asking for your vote so that we can break free from the failures of the past and create a New American Future.  I am asking for your vote so that we can achieve amazing things for the American people.  I am asking for the vote of every African-American, and Hispanic-American, who wants a better future – a future that begins with jobs, jobs and more jobs.  We will fix our disastrous trade deals and stand up to countries that cheat.  We will lower taxes and create millions of new jobs as a result.  We will unleash an American energy revolution.  We will eliminate job-killing regulations.  We will repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare.  We will enforce our immigration laws, and we will put rules in place that hire American workers first.  We will end the era of nation-building, and instead work in partnership with our allies to crush and destroy ISIS.  We will keep Radical Islamic Terrorism out of our country.  We will promote the values of tolerance, justice and acceptance.  We will steadfastly reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms.  America will be one nation – united in common purpose and common dreams. Our citizens will proudly promote our values and our system of government as the best in the world – and we will do so without apology.  Together, We Will Make America Prosperous Again.  We Will Make America Proud Again.  We Will Make America Safe Again.  Friends, citizens and fellow Americans: We Will Make America Great Again.  Thank you, and God Bless!   Donald J.

I love this state – where I once worked – and I love the people of this state.   I have a message for all of you tonight: we are going to win Ohio, we are going to win the White House, and we are going to bring back your jobs. We are going to negotiate fair trade deals that put American workers first.  We are going to stop the product dumping, the unfair foreign subsidies, and the currency manipulation.  We are going to stop the foreign cheating.  The era of economic surrender is over.  A new era of American Greatness is beginning.  No state has been hurt worse by the Hillary Clinton trade policies than Ohio.  Hillary Clinton backed her husband\\'s NAFTA, she backed China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organization, she backed the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and backed the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  One bad deal after another.  Hillary Clinton\\'s donors own her, and she will do whatever they tell her to do.  Ohio and the Akron area have lost nearly 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs since NAFTA.  This region and this state have lost nearly 1 in 4 manufacturing jobs since China entered the World Trade Organization.  Our trade deficit in goods with the world is now nearly $800 billion dollars.  This subtracts directly from our growth – our economy grew only 1.2 percent in the last quarter, a total disaster.  This is the legacy of Obama-Clinton.    I am promising a new legacy for America. We are going to create a New American Future. But to do that, we have to stop the Trans-Pacific Partnership.    Our trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost the state of Ohio more than 100,000 manufacturing jobs last year.  Imagine how many more jobs would be lost if TPP was actually approved.  Hillary Clinton, who called the TPP the \"Gold Standard\", would 100% approve it if she ever got in.  Her closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed that she would.  We won\\'t let that happen.  We will win this election, and we will keep America out of the TPP.  We will defend our freedom, our jobs, and our economic independence.  It\\'s going to be America First.  My economic plan is going to grow this economy, raise your wages, and create millions of new jobs.   Here are a few of the things we will do: A massive tax cut for working Americans, and a 15% tax rate for small businesses.  We are going to eliminate regulations that kill American jobs, and that includes getting rid of the Obama Administration\\'s new anti-energy rules that will raise Ohio energy bills by more than 40 percent.  These Obama-Clinton energy restrictions are a tax on the poor, and they devastate low-income African-American and Latino workers. Ohio gets 60% of its electricity from coal-powered energy.  Hillary Clinton says she wants to \"put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business.\"  Just like she wants to put the steel workers out of business.  We are going to put the miners and the steel workers back to work – and we are going to get your energy bills down.  We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, saving another 2 million jobs over the next decade.  Another major part of our agenda is law and order.  More than 2,600 have been shot in Chicago alone since the beginning of this year.  This is one of the biggest differences between me and my opponent.  I believe that safety is a right that belongs to all Americans.    Let me take this opportunity to thank the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.  Working with communities and police, I pledge to bring safety to communities across this land – but especially to those places that have not known safety in a very, very long time.  I want every parent and child in this society – including every African-American and Hispanic citizen – to be able to live in a safe, thriving and prosperous community.  This is the New American Future that we are working together to create.  Hillary Clinton is the past.  We are the future.  Another major part of our agenda is immigration security.  We need to protect American jobs.  We need to protect American safety.  Low-income workers are hurt the most by my opponent\\'s policies. Poor Hispanic and African-American citizens are the first to lose a job, or see a pay cut, when we don\\'t control our borders. According to Pew Research, immigration over the next fifty years will add another 100 million to our population.  It will be much, much more than even that under Hillary Clinton\\'s radical plans.  That\\'s unfair to the low-income workers – African-American, Latino, all Americans – living here today and trying to get ahead.  Hillary Clinton has forgotten the first rule of public service.  The job of an elected official is to serve the citizens of the United States.  If you don\\'t understand that, then you cannot run for President. If you are not prepared to put American workers first, then you should not hold or seek public office. It\\'s just that simple.  No issue better illustrates how corrupt my opponent is than her pay-for-play scandals as Secretary of State.  As the evidence has become public over the last several months, I have become increasingly shocked by the vast scope of Hillary Clinton\\'s criminality.   �Hillary Clinton said she turned over all of her work related emails.  She testified that to Congress under penalty of perjury. Now we learn about another 15,000 emails she failed to turn over have just been discovered.     Colin Powell just proved again how dishonest Hillary Clinton is after he busted her for trying to pin her email scandal on him – one more Hillary Clinton lie.     Her Foundation took in large payments from major corporations and wealthy individuals, foreign and domestic, all while she was Secretary of State.   The Clinton Foundation accepted as much as $60 million dollars from Middle Eastern countries that oppress women, gays and people of different faiths.   The Foundation donors included corporations and individuals with significant matters before the State Department. And then either Hillary Clinton herself or one of her closest aides took action favorable to the donor.   Her actions corrupted and disgraced one of the most important Departments of government, indeed one of only four established by the United States Constitution itself.   The Clintons\\' made the State Department into the same kind of Pay-to-Play operations as the Arkansas Government was: pay the Clinton Foundation huge sums of money and throw in some big speaking fees for Bill Clinton and you got to play with the State Department.   The amounts involved, the favors done and the significant numbers of times it was done require an expedited investigation by a Special Prosecutor. After the FBI and Department of Justice whitewash of the Clinton email crimes, they certainly cannot be trusted to quickly or impartially investigate Hillary Clinton\\'s crimes.   Some former prosecutors have even suggested that the coordination between the pay-for-play State Department and the corrupt Clinton Foundation constitute a clear example of a RICO (Racketeer Influenced Corrupt Organization) enterprise.   The Justice Department is required to appoint an independent Special Prosecutor because it has proven itself to be a political arm of the White House.     The DOJ has acted very unethically, particularly the Attorney General\\'s private lengthy meeting with Bill Clinton shortly before the Department\\'s decision not to prosecute her for crimes that would have been prosecuted against almost any other citizen.   If the Justice Department fails to do so, it will make it even clearer that a second of the four primary constitutional Departments have been corrupted.   Here is one example of Clinton Corruption.   As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton signed off on a deal allowing Russians to take an increased stake in a company called Uranium One, giving up control of about 20 percent of America\\'s uranium supply to the Russians. Clinton\\'s approval of the deal netted the owners of the uranium company millions of dollars. In exchange for signing off on the deal, some of the former owners of Uranium One gave the Clinton Foundation millions of dollars in donations. In addition, Bill Clinton received $500,000 for a speech to a Kremlin-backed investment firm that was a beneficiary of the deal.   �Here is another example of pay-for-play.   �In 2009, Ericsson telecommunications came under U.S. pressure for selling telecom equipment to several oppressive governments – including Sudan, Syria, and Iran.  Some these regimes used those technologies to monitor and control their own people.  In June 2011, Hillary Clinton\\'s State Department began adding goods and services to a list that might be covered under expanded sanctions on Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism.  During that time, Ericsson sponsored a speech by Bill Clinton, paying him $750,000 – his highest paying speech.  In April 2012, the Obama Administration issued an executive order imposing sanctions on telecom sales to Iran and Syria –but those sanctions did not cover Ericsson\\'s work in Iran.  A Trump Administration will end the government corruption.  No one will be above the law.  We will have one set of rules for everyone.  In Hillary Clinton\\'s world, we have one set of rules for her – and another set of rules for everyone else. I am fighting for everyone who doesn\\'t have a voice.  The forgotten men and women of America. I am your voice.  Hillary Clinton\\'s campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers.  My campaign is powered by my own money, but also by small dollar donations from working people across this country who want their country back.  Nothing terrifies the ruling class more than when everyday working people give 5, 10, or 15 dollars to our campaign to help us take government away from the special interests and give it back to the voters.  Come November 8th, we are once again going to have a government that serves you, your family, and your country.  We are going to rebuild our depleted military, avoid needless foreign wars, build new friendships overseas, and remember those three famous words: Peace Through Strength.  We are going to work with our allies to crush, defeat, and utterly destroy ISIS.  We are going to have a new immigration screening test to keep people out of our country who don\\'t support our tolerant values.  We are also going to reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton, who sees people of color only as votes and not as human beings worthy of a better future. The Democratic Party has run nearly every inner city for half a century or more.  They have produced only more poverty, failing schools, and broken homes.  In the last eight years, the African-American labor force participation has declined another 3 percentage points – and it\\'s dropped another 6 percent for teenagers.  Nearly 4 in 10 African-American children live in poverty.  African-American home ownership has declined nearly ten percentage points.  Meanwhile, since 2009, another 2 million Latinos have fallen into poverty.  Incomes for Latino workers fell by almost another $1,000 dollars. Meanwhile, homicides are up nearly 50 percent in Washington D.C. and more than 60 percent in Baltimore.  The level of crime in these cities is something no American should consider acceptable.  Our government has failed these residents.  For those hurting the most – who have been failed again and again by their politicians – I\\'ve asked in recent days, what do you have to lose by trying something new?  If you keep voting for the same failed politicians you will keep getting the same results.  But, most importantly, I want to talk about what you have to gain.  Those hurting in our county have so much to gain by joining our campaign for a new, and more inclusive, American Future.  My tax reforms will add millions of new jobs and thousands of new small businesses.    My energy reforms will create millions of new jobs and lower the price of your energy bill.  My trade reforms will raise wages, grow jobs and add trillions in new wealth into our country.  My immigration reforms will protect your jobs and stop businesses from exploiting visa programs that hurt poor workers.  My infrastructure plans will rebuild your roads, bridges and airports.  My regulatory reforms will make it easier for African-Americans small businesses to thrive, and for young children to live out their dreams.  My promise of school choice, charter schools and merit-pay for teachers will help low-income students in our inner cities.  Hillary Clinton discriminates against poor African-American children by opposing school choice.  My government reforms will make your voice heard – not the voice of the special interests. Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton. It\\'s the powerful protecting the powerful. Insiders fighting for insiders.  I am fighting for you.  Every day you turn on the nightly news, you hear about how some self-interested banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign.  Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign.  Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign. I wear their opposition as a badge of honor.  Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change.    I am fighting – all of us across the country are fighting – for peaceful regime change in our own country.  The media-donor-political complex that\\'s bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.  I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.  We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity – a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.  I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.    To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I\\'m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.  Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.  We Will Make American Safe Again.  And We Will Make America Great Again.    Thank you, and God Bless.', 'link_name': '', 'status_type': 'status', 'status_link': '', 'status_published': '8/23/2016 7:10:25', 'num_reactions': '25445', 'num_comments': '2192', 'num_shares': '2683', 'num_likes': '23077', 'num_loves': '2102', 'num_wows': '107', 'num_hahas': '90', 'num_sads': '8', 'num_angrys': '61'}, {'status_id': '153080620724_10157510424610725', 'status_message': 'It\\'s so great to be here tonight.  I am honored to also be joined this evening by Governor Scott Walker, Chairman Reince Prebius, and Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  We are at a decisive moment in this election.  Last week, I laid out my plan to bring jobs back to our country.  Yesterday, I laid out my plan to defeat Radical Islamic Terrorism.  Tonight, I am going to talk about how to make our communities safe again from crime and lawlessness.  Let me begin by thanking the law enforcement officers here in this city, and across this country, for their service and sacrifice in difficult times.  The violence, riots and destruction that have taken place in Milwaukee is an assault on the right of all citizens to live in security and peace.  Law and order must be restored. It must be restored for the sake of all, but most especially the sake of those living in the affected communities.  The main victims of these riots are law-abiding African-American citizens living in these neighborhoods.  It is their jobs, their homes, their schools and communities which will suffer as a result. There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct.  Crime and violence is an attack on the poor, and will never be accepted in a Trump Administration.  The narrative that has been pushed aggressively for years now by our current Administration, and pushed by my opponent Hillary Clinton, is a false one.  The problem in our poorest communities is not that there are too many police, the problem is that there are not enough police.    More law enforcement, more community engagement, more effective policing is what our country needs. Just like Hillary Clinton is against the miners, she is against the police. You know it, and I know it.  Those peddling the narrative of cops as a racist force in our society – a narrative supported with a nod by my opponent – share directly in the responsibility for the unrest in Milwaukee, and many other places within our country.  They have fostered the dangerous anti-police atmosphere in America.  Everytime we rush to judgment with false facts and narratives – whether in Ferguson or in Baltimore – and foment further unrest, we do a direct disservice to poor African-American residents who are hurt by the high crime in their communities.  During the last 72 hours, while protestors have raged against the police here in Milwaukee, another 9 were killed in Chicago and another 46 were wounded.  More than 2,600 people have been shot in Chicago since the beginning of the year, and almost 4,000 killed in President Obama\\'s hometown area since his presidency began. How are we serving these American victims by attacking law enforcement officers?  The war on our police must end.  It must end now!  The war on our police is a war on all peaceful citizens who want to be able to work and live and send their kids to school in safety.   Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the rioter, the looter, the violent disruptor.  Our job is to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent who wants their kids to be able to safely walk the streets.  Or the senior citizen waiting for a bus.  Or the young child walking home from school.  For every one violent protestor, there are a hundred of moms and dads and kids on that same city block who just want to be able to sleep safely at night.  My opponent would rather protect the offender than the victim.  Hillary Clinton-backed policies are responsible for the problems in the inner cities today, and a vote for her is a vote for another generation of poverty, high crime, and lost opportunities.  I care too much about my country to let that happen.   We all care too much about our country to let that happen. Good policing saves lives.    My dear friend, Rudy Giuliani, knows a thing or two about this.  The policies put into place by Rudy ultimately brought down crime by 76 percent and murder by 84 percent.  Think of how many families were saved, how much heartache was prevented, when police were put into communities and criminals were removed.  Imagine how many lives could have been saved, all across this country, if Democratic politicians hadn\\'t blocked in their cities what Rudy did in New York City?  I\\'ll make sure we deliver safe neighborhoods here in Milwaukee, and all across this country. It\\'s easy for Hillary Clinton to turn a blind eye to crime when she has her own private security force.  I believe all Americans, not just the powerful, are entitled to security.  Hillary Clinton has had her chance.  She failed.  Now it\\'s time for new leadership. The Hillary Clinton agenda hurts poor people the most.  There is no compassion in allowing drug dealers, gang members, and felons to prey on innocent people.  It is the first duty of government to keep the innocent safe, and when I am President I will fight for the safety of every American – and especially those Americans who have not known safety for a very, very long time. I am asking for the vote of every African-American citizen struggling in our country today who wants a different future.  It is time for our society to address some honest and very difficult truths.  The Democratic Party has failed and betrayed the African-American community.  Democratic crime policies, education policies, and economic policies have produced only more crime, more broken homes, and more poverty.  Let us look at the situation right here in Milwaukee, a city run by Democrats for decade after decade.  Last year, killings in this city increased by 69 percent, plus another 634 victims of non-fatal shootings.  18-29-year-olds accounted for nearly half of the homicide victims.  The poverty rate here is nearly double the national average.  Almost 4 in 10 African-American men in Milwaukee between the ages of 25-54 do not have a job.  Nearly Four in 10 single mother households are living in poverty.  55 public schools in this city have been rated as failing to meet expectations, despite ten thousand dollars in funding per-pupil. There is only a 60% graduation rate, and it\\'s one of the worst public school systems in the country.  1 in 5 manufacturing jobs has disappeared in Milwaukee since we fully opened our markets to China, and many African-American neighborhoods have borne the brunt of this hit.  To every voter in Milwaukee, to every voter living in every inner city, or every forgotten stretch of our society, I am running to offer you a better future.   The Democratic Party has taken the votes of African-Americans for granted.  They\\'ve just assumed they\\'ll get your support and done nothing in return for it.  It\\'s time to give the Democrats some competition for these votes, and it\\'s time to rebuild the inner cities of America – and to reject the failed leadership of a rigged political system.  I\\'m not part of the corrupt system. In fact, the corrupt system is trying to stop me.  I\\'ve been paying my own way.  The voters in the Republican Party this year defied the donors, the consultants, the power brokers, and choose a nominee from outside our failed and corrupt and broken system.    The other party – the Democratic Party – nominated the personification of special interest corruption.  The Democratic Party rigged the nomination to give it to Hillary Clinton, thus giving the soul of their party this year to the special interests.  I am running to listen to your voice, to hear your cries for help.  The quiet voices in our society, not the loudest demonstrators, need to have their demands heard.  Jobs. Safety. Opportunity. Fair and equal representation.  We reject the bigotry of Hillary Clinton which panders to and talks down to communities of color and sees them only as votes, not as individual human beings worthy of a better future.  She doesn\\'t care at all about the hurting people of this country, or the suffering she has caused them.  The African-American community has been taken for granted for decades by the Democratic Party.  It\\'s time to break with the failures of the past – I want to offer Americans a new future. It is time for rule by the people, not rule by special interests.  Every insider, getting rich off of our broken system, is throwing money at Hillary Clinton.  The hedge fund managers, the Wall Street investors, the professional political class.    It\\'s the powerful protecting the powerful.  Insiders fighting for insiders.    I am fighting for you!  When we talk about the insider, who are we talking about?  It\\'s the comfortable politicians looking out for their own interests.  It\\'s the lobbyists who know how to insert that perfect loophole into every bill.  It\\'s the financial industry knows how to regulate their competition out of existence.  The insiders also include the media executives, anchors and journalists in Washington, Los Angeles, and New York City, who are part of the same failed status quo and want nothing to change.  Every day you pick up a newspaper, or turn on the nightly news, and hear about how some banker or some Washington insider says they oppose our campaign.  Or some encrusted old politician says they oppose our campaign.  Or some big time lobbyist says they oppose our campaign.  I wear their opposition as a badge of honor.  Because it means I am fighting for REAL change, not just partisan change.  I am fighting – all of us across the country are fighting – for peaceful regime change in our own country.  The media-donor-political complex that\\'s bled this country dry has to be replaced with a new government of, by and for the people.  The leadership class in Washington D.C., of which Hillary Clinton has been a member for thirty years, has abandoned the people of this country.  I am going to give the people their voice back. Think about it.  The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have left our border open and let innocent people suffer as a result.  The people opposing our campaign are the same people who have led us into one disastrous foreign war after another. The people opposing our campaign are the same people who lied to us about one trade deal after another.  Aren\\'t you tired of a system that gets rich at your expense?  Aren\\'t you tired of big media, big businesses, and big donors rigging the system to keep your voice from being heard?  Are you ready for change?  Are you ready for leadership that puts you, the American people, first? That puts your country first? That puts your family first? Let\\'s talk about what this means for the inner cities of America.    It\\'s time to break through the television noise, the entrenched interests.  I understand that a lot of powerful people in our political system – a lot of people who\\'ve created our problems – will lose a lot of their contracts, and their special gigs, if African-American voters, and all minority voters, support my campaign.    It\\'s time to stop making the special interests rich.  It\\'s time to make the American people rich.  I am going to Make America Wealthy Again.  The Democratic Party has run every inner city in this country for 50 years, and run them into financial ruin.  They\\'ve ruined the schools.   They\\'ve driven out the jobs.  They\\'ve tolerated a level of crime no American should consider acceptable.  Violent crime has risen 17% in America\\'s 50 largest cities last year.  Killings of police officers this year is up nearly 50 percent.  Homicides are up more than 60% in Baltimore. They are up more than 50% in Washington, D.C.    This is future offered by Hillary Clinton. More poverty, more crime, and more of the same.  The future she offers is the most pessimistic thing I can possibly imagine.  It is time for a different future.   Here is what I am proposing.  First, on immigration.  No community in this country has been hurt worse by Hillary Clinton\\'s immigration policies than the African-American community.  Now she is proposing to print instant work permits for millions of illegal immigrants, taking jobs directly from low-income Americans.  I will secure our border, protect our workers, and improve jobs and wages in your community. We will only invite people to join our country who share our tolerant values, who support our Constitution, and who love all of our people.  On trade, I am going to renegotiate NAFTA, stand up to China, withdraw from the TPP, and protect every last American job. On taxes, I am going to give a massive tax cut to every worker and small business in this country, bring thousands of new companies and millions of new jobs onto our shores – and make it very difficult for our businesses to leave.  I am going to reform our regulations so jobs stay in America, and new businesses come to America to hire workers right here in Milwaukee.  Every policy my opponent has sends jobs overseas. I am going to bring trillions in new wealth back to the United States.  On education, it is time to have school choice, merit pay for teachers, and to end the tenure policies that hurt good teachers and reward bad teachers. We are going to put students and parents first.   Hillary Clinton would deny opportunities to millions of young African-American children, just so she can curry favor with the education bureaucracy.  I am going to allow charter schools to thrive, and help young kids get on the American ladder of success: a good education, and a good-paying job.  On crime, I am going to support more police in our communities, appoint the best prosecutors and judges in the country, pursue strong enforcement of federal laws, and I am going to break up the gangs, the cartels and criminal syndicates terrorizing our neighborhoods.  To every lawbreaker hurting innocent people in this country, I say: your free reign will soon come crashing to an end.  On healthcare, we are going to get rid of Obamacare – which has caused soaring double-digit premium increases – and give choice to patients and consumers.  Aetna, just today, announced they are dropping out – as are many of the major insurance companies.  On government corruption, I am going to restore honor to our government.  We\\'ve seen the corruption of Hillary Clinton, the mass email deletions, the pay-for-play at the State Department, the profiteering, the favors given to foreign corporations and governments at your expense.  We\\'ve seen a former Secretary of State lie to Congress about her illegal email scheme, risk innocent American lives, and bring dishonor onto our government. In my Administration, I am going to enforce all laws concerning the protection of classified information.  No one will be above the law. I am going to forbid senior officials from trading favors for cash by preventing them from collecting lavish speaking fees through their spouses when they serve.  I am going to ask my senior officials to sign an agreement not to accept speaking fees from corporations with a registered lobbyist for five years after leaving office, or from any entity tied to a foreign government. This is all just the beginning.  We are going to make this a government of the people once again.  This is our chance to take back power from all the people who\\'ve taken it from you.  The reason you see the establishment media lining up behind my opponent is because they are scared that you, with your vote, can take away their power and return it to your family and community.  These are tough times.  But I know we can make American Greater Than Ever Before.  To do this, we are going to need a fighter in the White House.  I will be your fighter.  To defeat crime and Radical Islamic Terrorism in our country, to win trade in our country, you need tremendous physical and mental strength and stamina.  Hillary Clinton doesn\\'t have that strength and stamina.  She cannot win for you.  Most importantly, she has bad judgment.  Bad judgment on terrorism, bad judgement on foreign policy, bad judgment on trade.   The only individuals she\\'s ever delivered for is her donors – not the people.  I\\'ve said it before, and I\\'ll say it again.  My opponent asks her supporters to repeat three-word pledge.    Her pledge reads: \"I\\'m With Her.\"  I choose to recite a different pledge.  My pledge reads: \"I\\'m With You – the American people.\"  I will fight to ensure that every American is treated equally, protected equally, and honored equally.  We will reject bigotry and hatred and oppression in all of its forms, and seek a new future of security, prosperity and opportunity – a future built on our common culture and values as one American people.  I am asking for your vote so I can be your champion in the White House.  We will once again be a country of law and order, and a country of great success.  To every parent who dreams for their children, and to every child who dreams for their future, I say these words to you tonight: I\\'m with you, I will fight for you, and I will win for you.  Together, We Will Make America Strong Again.  We Will Make American Safe Again.  And We Will Make America Great Again.    Thank you, and God Bless, Donald J.

It\\'s wonderful to be in Detroit. We now begin a great national conversation about economic renewal for America.  It\\'s a conversation about how to Make American Great Again for everyone, and especially those who have the very least.  The City of Detroit Is Where Our Story Begins Detroit was once the economic envy of the world.  The people of Detroit helped power America to its position of global dominance in the 20th century. When we were governed by an America First policy, Detroit was booming.  Engineers, builders, laborers, shippers and countless others went to work each day, provided for their families, and lived out the American Dream. But for many living in this city, that dream has long ago vanished.  When we abandoned the policy of America First, we started rebuilding other countries instead of our own.  The skyscrapers went up in Beijing, and in many other cities around the world, while the factories and neighborhoods crumbled in Detroit.  Our roads and bridges fell into disrepair, yet we found the money to resettle millions of refugees at taxpayer expense.  Today, Detroit has a per capita income of under $15,000 dollars, about half of the national average.  40 percent of the city\\'s residents live in poverty, over two-and-half times the national average. The unemployment rate is more than twice the national average. Half of all Detroit residents do not work. Detroit tops the list of Most Dangerous Cities in terms of violent crime – these are the silenced victims whose stories are never told by Hillary Clinton, but victims whose suffering is no less real or permanent.    In short, the city of Detroit is the living, breathing example of my opponent\\'s failed economic agenda.  Every policy that has failed this city, and so many others, is a policy supported by Hillary Clinton.   She supports the high taxes and radical regulation that forced jobs out of your community…and the crime policies that have made you less safe…and the immigration policies that have strained local budgets...and the trade deals like NAFTA, signed by her husband, that have shipped your jobs to Mexico and other countries… and she supports the education policies that deny your students choice, freedom and opportunity.   She is the candidate of the past.   Ours is the campaign of the future.   This is a city controlled by Democratic politicians at every level, and unless we change policies, we will not change results.   Today, I will outline my economic vision.  In the coming weeks, we will be offering more detail on all of these policies, and the ones we have already rolled out can be viewed on my campaign website.   Our opposition, on the other hand, has long ago run out of ideas.  All Hillary Clinton has to offer is more of the same: more taxes, more regulations, more bureaucrats, more restrictions on American energy and American production.     If you were a foreign power looking to weaken America, you couldn\\'t do better than Hillary Clinton\\'s economic agenda.     Nothing would make our foreign adversaries happier than for our country to tax and regulate our companies and our jobs out of existence.   The one common feature of every Hillary Clinton idea is that it punishes you for working and doing business in the United States.  Every policy she has tilts the playing field towards other countries at our expense.   That\\'s why she tries to distract us with tired political rhetoric that seeks to label us, divide us, and pull us apart.   My campaign is about reaching out to everyone as Americans, and returning to a government that puts the American people first.   Here is what an America First economic plan looks like.   First, let\\'s talk tax reform.   Taxes are one of the biggest differences in this race.   Hillary Clinton – who has spent her career voting for tax increases – plans another massive job-killing $1.3 trillion-dollar tax increase.  Her plan would tax many small businesses by almost fifty percent.     Recently, at a campaign event, Hillary Clinton short-circuited again – to use a now famous term – when she accidentally told the truth and said she wanted to raise taxes on the middle class.   I am proposing an across-the-board income tax reduction, especially for middle-income Americans. This will lead to millions of new good-paying jobs.   The rich will pay their fair share, but no one will pay so much that it destroys jobs, or undermines our ability to compete.    As part of this reform, we will eliminate the Carried Interest Deduction and other special interest loopholes that have been so good for Wall Street investors, and people like me, but unfair to American workers.   Tax simplification will be a major feature of the plan.   Our current tax code is so burdensome and complex that we waste 9 billion hours a year in tax code compliance.   My plan will reduce the current number of brackets from 7 to 3, and dramatically streamline the process.  We will work with House Republicans on this plan, using the same brackets they have proposed: 12, 25 and 33 percent.  For many American workers, their tax rate will be zero.   While we will develop our own set of assumptions and policies, agreeing in some areas but not in others, we will be focused on the same shared goals and guided by the same shared principles: jobs, growth and opportunity.  These reforms will offer the biggest tax revolution since the Reagan Tax Reform, which unleashed years of continued economic growth and job creation.     We will Make America Grow Again.   In the days ahead, we will provide more details on this plan and how it will help you and your family.  It will present a night-and-day contrast to the job-killing, tax-raising, poverty-inducing Obama-Clinton agenda.   The State of New York has already lived through Hillary Clinton\\'s failed leadership.  The Washington Post just published a devastating article on Hillary Clinton\\'s broken promises.  She pledged 200,000 jobs for upstate New York as Senator.  But what happened?  The Washington Post writes, and I quote: \"upstate job growth stagnated overall during her tenure, with manufacturing jobs plunging nearly 25 percent…the former first lady was unable to pass big ticket legislation… Many promised jobs never materialized and others migrated to other states as she turned to her first presidential run…data shows that upstate actually lost jobs during Clinton\\'s first term.\"   Compare that to my record.  In a recent New York Post article by Steve Cuozzo, \"How Donald Trump Helped Save New York City,\" the paper writes that I – and this is a direct quote – \"waded into a landscape of empty Fifth Avenue storefronts, the dust-bowl mugging ground that was Central Park and a Wall Street area seemingly on its last legs as companies moved out…almost by force of will — [he] rode to the rescue. Expressing rare faith in the future, he was instrumental in kick-starting the regeneration of neighborhoods and landmarks almost given up for dead.\"   This is what I want to do for our country – I want to jumpstart America.   Now let\\'s look at what the Obama-Clinton policies have done nationally.   Their policies produced 1.2% growth, the weakest so-called recovery since the Great Depression, and a doubling of the national debt.   There are now 94.3 million Americans outside the labor force.  It was 80.5 million when President Obama took office, an increase of nearly 14 million people.   The Obama-Clinton agenda of tax, spend and regulate has created a silent nation of jobless Americans.   Home ownership is at its lowest rate in 51 years.   Nearly 12 million have been added to the food stamp rolls since President Obama took office.  Another nearly 7 million Americans are living in poverty.   We have the lowest labor force participation rates in four decades.   58 percent of African-American youth are either outside the labor force or not employed.   1 in 5 American households do not have a single member in the labor force.  These are the real unemployment numbers – the five percent figure is one of the biggest hoaxes in modern politics.   Meanwhile, American households are earning more than $4,000 less today than they were sixteen years ago.   The average worker today pays 31.5 percent of their wages to income and payroll taxes.  On top of that, state and local taxes consume another 10 percent.  The United States also has the highest business tax rate among the major industrialized nations of the world, at 35 percent.   It\\'s almost 40 percent when you add in taxes at the state level.   In other words, we punish companies for making products in America – but let them ship products into the U.S. tax-free if they move overseas. This is backwards.  All of our policies should be geared towards keeping jobs and wealth inside the United States.  Under my plan, no American company will pay more than 15% of their business income in taxes.  Small businesses will benefit the most from this plan.  Hillary Clinton\\'s plan will require small business to pay as much as three times more in taxes than what I am proposing, and her onerous regulations will put them totally out of business.  I am going to cut regulations massively. Our lower business tax will also end job-killing corporate inversions, and cause trillions in new dollars and wealth to come pouring into our country – and into cities like Detroit.   To help unleash this new job creation, we will allow businesses to immediately expense new business investments.  No one will gain more from these proposals than low-and-middle income Americans. My plan will also help reduce the cost of childcare by allowing parents to fully deduct the average cost of childcare spending from their taxes. We are also going to bring back trillions of dollars from American businesses that is now parked overseas.  Our plan will bring that cash home, applying a 10 percent tax.  This money will be re-invested in states like Michigan.  Finally, no family will have to pay the death tax.  American workers have paid taxes their whole lives, and they should not be taxed again at death – it\\'s just plain wrong. We will repeal it. Next comes regulatory reform  As with taxes, I will have one overriding goal when it comes to regulation: I want to keep jobs and wealth in America  Motor vehicle manufacturing is one of the most heavily regulated industries in the country. The U.S. economy today is twenty-five percent smaller than it would have been without the surge of regulations since 1980.  It is estimated that current overregulation is costing our economy as much as $2 trillion dollars a year – that\\'s money taken straight out of cities like yours. The federal register is now over 80,000 pages long. As the Wall Street Journal noted, President Obama has issued close to four hundred new major regulations since taking office, each with a cost to the American economy of $100 million or more. In 2015 alone, the Obama Administration unilaterally issued more than 2,000 new regulations – each a hidden tax on American consumers, and a massive lead weight on the American economy. It is time to remove the anchor dragging us down.  Upon taking office, I will issue a temporary moratorium on new agency regulations.  My running mate, Mike Pence, signed a similar order when he became governor of Indiana. This will give our American companies the certainty they need to reinvest in our community, get cash off of the sidelines, start hiring for new jobs, and expanding businesses.  I will also immediately cancel all illegal and overreaching executive orders. Next, I will ask each and every federal agency to prepare a list of all of the regulations they impose on Americans which are not necessary, do not improve public safety, and which needlessly kill jobs.  Those regulations will be eliminated. We are in a competition with the world, and I want America to win.  When I am president, we will.   One of the most important reforms of all is trade reform.   As Bernie Sanders has said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgment.  We\\'ve seen this bad judgment overseas, in Libya, Iraq, and Syria.  We\\'ve seen it in Iran.  We\\'ve seen it from President Obama, when he gives $150 billion to Iran, the number one terror state, and even gives them $400 million in money-laundered cash as a ransom payment. But we\\'ve also seen the terrible Obama-Clinton judgment right here in Detroit Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth.   She supported Bill Clinton\\'s NAFTA, she supported China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organization, she supported the job-killing trade deal with South Korea, and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Let\\'s talk about South Korea for a moment, because it so perfectly illustrates the broken promises that have hurt so many American workers.    President Obama, and the usual so-called experts who\\'ve been wrong about every trade deal for decades, predicted that the trade deal with South Korea would increase our exports to South Korea by more than $10 billion – resulting in some 70,000 jobs.  Like Hillary Clinton\\'s broken promises to New York, these pledges all turned out to be false. Instead of creating 70,000 jobs, it has killed nearly 100,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute.  Our exports to South Korea haven\\'t increased at all, but their imports to us have surged more than $15 billion – more than doubling our trade deficit with that country.  The next betrayal will be the Trans-Pacific Partnership.  Hillary Clinton\\'s closest friend, Terry McAuliffe, confirmed what I have said on this from the beginning: if sent to the Oval Office, Hillary Clinton will enact the TPP. Guaranteed.  Her donors will make sure of it. A vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for TPP – and it\\'s also a vote for NAFTA. Our annual trade deficit in goods with Mexico has risen from close to zero in 1993 to almost $60 billion.  Our total trade deficit in goods hit nearly $800 billion last year.  This is a strike at the heart of Michigan, and our nation as a whole.    According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, before NAFTA went into effect, there were 285,000 auto workers in Michigan.  Today, that number is only 160,000 Detroit is still waiting for Hillary Clinton\\'s apology. I expect Detroit will get that apology right around the same time Hillary Clinton turns over the 33,000 emails she deleted.  Hillary Clinton\\'s Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will be an even bigger disaster for the auto industry.  In fact, Ford Motor Company has announced its opposition to the deal.  According to the Economic Policy Institute, the U.S. trade deficit with the proposed TPP member countries cost over 1 million manufacturing jobs in 2015. By far the biggest losses occurred in motor vehicles and parts, which lost nearly 740,000 manufacturing jobs.  Michigan ranks first for jobs lost as a share of state workforce due to the trade deficit with TPP members. Just imagine how many more automobile jobs will be lost if the TPP is actually approved.  That is why I have announced we will withdraw from the deal before that can ever happen.  Hillary Clinton will never withdraw from the TPP. She is bought, controlled and paid-for by her donors and special interests.  Because my only interest is the American people, I have previously laid out a detailed 7-point plan for trade reform, available on my website.  It includes strong protections against currency manipulation, tariffs against any countries that cheat by unfairly subsidizing their goods, and it includes a renegotiation of NAFTA.  If we don\\'t get a better deal, we will walk away.  At the center of my plan is trade enforcement with China.  This alone could return millions of jobs into our economy.    China is responsible for nearly half of our entire trade deficit.  They break the rules in every way imaginable.  China engages in illegal export subsidies, prohibited currency manipulation, and rampant theft of intellectual property.  They also have no real environmental or labor protections, further undercutting American workers. Just enforcing intellectual property rules alone could save millions of American jobs.  According to the U.S. International Trade Commission, improved protection of America\\'s intellectual property in China would produce more than 2 million more jobs right here in the United States. Add to that the saved jobs from cracking down on currency cheating and product dumping, and we will bring trillions of dollars in new wealth and wages back to the United States.  Trade has big benefits, and I am in favor of trade.  But I want great trade deals for our country that create more jobs and higher wages for American workers.  Isolation is not an option, only great and well-crafted trade deals are.  Also critical to our economic renewal will be energy reform. The Obama-Clinton Administration has blocked and destroyed millions of jobs through their anti-energy regulations, while raising the price of electricity for both families and businesses.   As a result of recent Obama EPA actions coal-fired power plants across Michigan have either shut down entirely or undergone expensive conversions. The Obama-Clinton war on coal has cost Michigan over 50,000 jobs. Hillary Clinton says her plan will \"put a lot of coal companies and coal miners out of business.\"     We will put our coal miners and steel workers back to work.   Clinton not only embraces President Obama\\'s job-killing energy restrictions but wants to expand them, including going after oil and natural gas production that employs some 10 million Americans.   According to the Heritage Foundation, by 2030, the Obama-Clinton energy restrictions will eliminate another half a million manufacturing jobs, reduce economic output by $2.5 trillion dollars, and reduce incomes by $7,000 dollars per person.   A Trump Administration will end this war on the American worker, and unleash an energy revolution that will bring vast new wealth to our country.   According to the Institute for Energy Research, lifting the restrictions on all sources of American energy will:   • Increase GDP by more than $100 billion dollars annually, add over 500,000 new jobs annually, and increase annual wages by more than $30 billion dollars over the next 7 years;   • Increase federal, state, and local tax revenues by almost $6 trillion dollars over 4 decades;   • Increase total economic activity by more than $20 trillion dollars over the next 40 years.     The reforms I have outlined today are only the beginning   When we reform our tax, trade, energy and regulatory policies, we will open a new chapter in American Prosperity.   We can use this new wealth to rebuild our military and our infrastructure.     As part of this new future, we will also be rolling out proposals to increase choice and reduce cost in childcare, offering much-needed relief to American families.  I will unveil my plan on this in the coming weeks that I have been working on with my daughter Ivanka and an incredible team of experts.   Likewise, our education reforms will help parents send their kids to a school of their choice.   We will also give our police and law enforcement the funds and support they need to restore law and order to this country.  Without security, there can be no prosperity.  We must have law and order.   In the coming days, we will be rolling out plans on all of these items.  One of my first acts as President will be to repeal and replace disastrous Obamacare, saving another 2 million American jobs.   We will also rebuild our military, and get our allies to pay their fair share for the protection we provide – saving us countless more billions to invest in our own country.   We also have a plan, on our website, for a complete reform of the Veterans Health Administration.  This is something so desperately needed to make sure our vets are fully supported and get the care they deserve.   Detroit – the Motor City – will come roaring back.  We will offer a new future, not the same old failed policies of the past.   Our party has chosen to make new history by selecting a nominee from outside the rigged and corrupt system.   The other party has reached backwards into the past to choose a nominee from yesterday – who offers only the rhetoric of yesterday, and the policies of yesterday.   There will be no change under Hillary Clinton – only four more years of Obama.   But we are going to look boldly into the future.  We will build the next generation of roads, bridges, railways, tunnels, sea ports and airports that our country deserves.   American cars will travel the roads, American planes will connect our cities, and American ships will patrol the seas.   American steel will send new skyscrapers soaring.   We will put new American metal into the spine of this nation.   It will be American hands that rebuild this country, and it will be American energy - mined from American sources - that powers this country.  It will be American workers who are hired to do the job.  Americanism, not globalism, will be our new credo.  Our country will reach amazing new heights.  All we have to do is stop relying on the tired voices of the past.  We can\\'t fix a rigged system by relying on the people who rigged it in the first place.  We can\\'t solve our problems by relying on the politicians who created them.  Only by changing to new leadership, and new solutions, will we get new results.  We need to stop believing in politicians, and start believing in America.   Before everything great that has ever happened, the doubters have always said it couldn\\'t be done.   America is ready to prove the doubters wrong.   They want you to think small.  I am asking you to think big.   We are ready to dream great things for our country once again.   We are ready to show the world that America is Back – Bigger, and Better and Stronger Than Ever Before.

TRUMP ON THE STAKES OF THE ELECTION  Today I\\'d like to share my thoughts about the stakes in this election.  People have asked me why I am running for President.  I have built an amazing business that I love and I get to work side-by-side with my children every day.  We come to work together and turn visions into reality.  We think big, and then we make it happen.  I love what I do, and I am grateful beyond words to the nation that has allowed me to do it.  So when people ask me why I am running, I quickly answer: I am running to give back to this country which has been so good to me.  When I see the crumbling roads and bridges, or the dilapidated airports, or the factories moving overseas to Mexico, or to other countries, I know these problems can all be fixed, but not by Hillary Clinton – only by me.  The fact is, we can come back bigger and better and stronger than ever before --Jobs, jobs, jobs!  Everywhere I look, I see the possibilities of what our country could be. But we can\\'t solve any of these problems by relying on the politicians who created them.  We will never be able to fix a rigged system by counting on the same people who rigged it in the first place.  The insiders wrote the rules of the game to keep themselves in power and in the money.  That\\'s why we\\'re asking Bernie Sanders\\' voters to join our movement: so together we can fix the system for ALL Americans. Importantly, this includes fixing all of our many disastrous trade deals.  Because it\\'s not just the political system that\\'s rigged. It\\'s the whole economy.  It\\'s rigged by big donors who want to keep down wages.  It\\'s rigged by big businesses who want to leave our country, fire our workers, and sell their products back into the U.S. with absolutely no consequences for them.  It\\'s rigged by bureaucrats who are trapping kids in failing schools.  It\\'s rigged against you, the American people.  Hillary Clinton who, as most people know, is a world class liar –  just look at her pathetic email and server statements, or her phony landing in Bosnia where she said she was under attack but the attack turned out to be young girls handing her flowers, a total self-serving lie.[1]  Brian Williams\\' career was destroyed for saying far less.  Yesterday, she even tried to attack me and my many businesses. But here is the bottom line: I started off in Brooklyn New York, not so long ago, with a small loan and built a business worth over 10 billion dollars. I have always had a talent for building businesses and, importantly, creating jobs. That is a talent our country desperately needs.  I am running for President to end the unfairness and to put you, the American worker, first.  We are going to put America First, and we are going to Make America Great again.  This election will decide whether we are ruled by the people, or by the politicians.  Here is my promise to the American voter:  If I am elected President, I will end the special interest monopoly in Washington, D.C.  The other candidate in this race has spent her entire life making money for special interests – and taking money from special interests.  Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and theft.  She ran the State Department like her own personal hedge fund – doing favors for oppressive regimes, and many others, in exchange for cash.  Then, when she left, she made $21.6 million giving speeches to Wall Street banks and other special interests – in less than 2 years – secret speeches that she does not want to reveal to the public. [2] [3]  Together, she and Bill made $153 million giving speeches to lobbyists, CEOs, and foreign governments in the years since 2001.[4]  They totally own her, and that will never change.  The choice in this election is a choice between taking our government back from the special interests, or surrendering our last scrap of independence to their total and complete control.  Those are the stakes.  Hillary Clinton wants to be President. But she doesn\\'t have the temperament, or, as Bernie Sanders\\' said, the judgement, to be president.  She believes she is entitled to the office.  Her campaign slogan is \"I\\'m with her.\"  You know what my response to that is? I\\'m with you: the American people.  She thinks it\\'s all about her.  I know it\\'s all about you – I know it\\'s all about making America Great Again for All Americans.  Our country lost its way when we stopped putting the American people first.  We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism – focusing on what\\'s good for America\\'s middle class – to a policy of globalism, focusing on how to make money for large corporations who can move their wealth and workers to foreign countries all to the detriment of the American worker and the American economy.  We reward companies for offshoring, and we punish companies for doing business in America and keeping our workers employed.  This is not a rising tide that lifts all boats.  This is a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs.  We need to reform our economic system so that, once again, we can all succeed together, and America can become rich again.  That\\'s what we mean by America First.  Our country will be better off when we start making our own products again, bringing our once great manufacturing capabilities back to our shores.  Our Founders understood this.  One of the first major bills signed by George Washington called for \"the encouragement and protection of manufactur[ing]\" in America.[5]  Our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln, warned us by saying:  \"The abandonment of the protective policy by the American government will produce want and ruin among our people.\"[6]  I have visited the cities and towns across America and seen the devastation caused by the trade policies of Bill and Hillary Clinton.  Hillary Clinton supported Bill Clinton\\'s disastrous NAFTA, just like she supported China\\'s entrance into the World Trade Organization.[7]  We\\'ve lost nearly one-third of our manufacturing jobs since these two Hillary-backed agreements were signed.[8]  Our trade deficit with China soared 40% during Hillary Clinton\\'s time as Secretary of State -- a disgraceful performance for which she should not be congratulated, but rather scorned.[9]  Then she let China steal hundreds of billions of dollars in our intellectual property – a crime which is continuing to this day.[10]  Hillary Clinton gave China millions of our best jobs, and effectively let China completely rebuild itself.  In return, Hillary Clinton got rich!  The book Clinton Cash, by Peter Schweitzer, documents how Bill and Hillary used the State Department to enrich their family at America\\'s expense.  She gets rich making you poor.  Here is a quote from the book: \"At the center of US policy toward China was Hillary Clinton…at this critical time for US-china relations, Bill Clinton gave a number of speeches that were underwritten by the Chinese government and its supporters.\"  These funds were paid to the Clinton bank account while Hillary was negotiating with China on behalf of the United States.[11]  She sold out our workers, and our country, for Beijing.  Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas – and give up Congressional power to an international foreign commission.[12]  Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. She has even deleted this record of total support from her book – deletion is something she is very good at -- (at least 30,000 emails are missing.)[13]  But this latest Clinton cover-up doesn\\'t change anything: if she is elected president, she will adopt the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we will lose millions of jobs and our economic independence for good. She will do this, just as she has betrayed the American worker on trade at every single stage of her career – and it will be even worse than the Clintons\\' NAFTA deal.  I want trade deals, but they have to be great for the United States and our workers.  We don\\'t make great deals anymore, but we will once I become president.  It\\'s not just our economy that\\'s been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.  The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives and trillions of dollars – and unleashed ISIS across the world.  No Secretary of State has been more wrong, more often, and in more places than Hillary Clinton.  Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.  Among the victims is our late Ambassador, Chris Stevens. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed -- that\\'s right, when the phone rang at 3 o\\'clock in the morning, she was sleeping.  Ambassador Stevens and his staff in Libya made hundreds of requests for security.[14]  Hillary Clinton\\'s State Department refused them all.  She started the war that put him in Libya, denied him the security he asked for, then left him there to die.  To cover her tracks, Hillary lied about a video being the cause of his death.[15]  Here is what one of the victim\\'s mothers had to say:  \"I want the whole world to know it: she lied to my face, and you don\\'t want this person to be president.\"[16]  In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.  Libya was cooperating.  Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence.  Syria was under control.  Iran was being choked by sanctions.  Egypt was governed by a friendly regime that honored its peace treaty with Israel.  ISIS wasn\\'t even on the map.  Fast forward to 2013: In just four years, Secretary Clinton managed  to almost single-handedly destabilize the entire Middle East.  Her invasion of Libya handed the country over to the ISIS barbarians.  Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons.  Hillary Clinton\\'s support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen – while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.[17]  She helped force out a friendly regime in Egypt and replace it with the radical Muslim Brotherhood. The Egyptian military has retaken control, but Clinton has opened the Pandora\\'s box of radical Islam.  Then, there was the disastrous strategy of announcing our departure date from Iraq, handing large parts of the country over to ISIS killers.[18]  ISIS threatens us today because of the decisions Hillary Clinton has made.  ISIS also threatens peaceful Muslims across the Middle East, and peaceful Muslims across the world, who have been terribly victimized by horrible brutality – and who only want to raise their kids in peace and safety.  In short, Hillary Clinton\\'s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another.  It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place.[19]  Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started.[20]  But Hillary Clinton learned nothing from Iraq, because when she got into power, she couldn\\'t wait to rush us off to war in Libya.  She lacks the temperament, the judgment and the competence to lead.  In the words of a Secret Service agent posted outside the Oval Office:  \"She simply lacks the integrity and temperament to serve  in the office…from the bottom of my soul, I know this to be true…Her leadership style – volcanic, impulsive…disdainful of the rules set for everyone else – hasn\\'t changed a bit.\"[21]  Perhaps the most terrifying thing about Hillary Clinton\\'s foreign policy is that she refuses to acknowledge the threat posed by Radical Islam.  In fact, Hillary Clinton supports a radical 550% increase in Syrian refugees coming into the United States, and that\\'s an increase over President Obama\\'s already very high number.[22]  Under her plan, we would admit hundreds of thousands of refugees from the most dangerous countries on Earth – with no way to screen who they are or what they believe.[23] [24]  Already, hundreds of recent immigrants and their children have been convicted of terrorist activity inside the U.S.[25]  The father of the Orlando shooter was a Taliban supporter from Afghanistan, one of the most repressive anti-gay and anti-women regimes on Earth.[26]  I only want to admit people who share our values and love our people.  Hillary Clinton wants to bring in people who believe women should be enslaved and gays put to death.  Maybe her motivation lies among the more than 1,000 foreign donations Hillary failed to disclose while at the State Department.[27]  Hillary Clinton may be the most corrupt person ever to seek the presidency.  Here is some more of what we learned from the book, Clinton Cash:  A foreign telecom giant faced possible State Department sanctions for providing technology to Iran, and other oppressive regimes. So what did this company do? For the first time ever, they decided to pay Bill Clinton $750,000 for a single speech. The Clintons got their cash, the telecom company escaped sanctions.[28] Hillary Clinton\\'s State Department approved the transfer of 20% of America\\'s uranium holdings to Russia, while 9 investors in the deal funneled $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.[29] Hillary Clinton appointed a top donor to a national security board with top secret access – even though he had no national security credentials.[30] Hillary Clinton accepted $58,000 in jewelry from the government of Brunei when she was Secretary of State – plus millions more for her foundation. The Sultan of Brunei has pushed oppressive Sharia law, including the punishment of death by stoning for being gay. The government of Brunei also stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of Hillary\\'s Trans-Pacific Partnership, which she would absolutely approve if given the chance. [31] Hillary Clinton took up to $25 million from Saudi Arabia, where being gay is also punishable by death.[32] Hillary took millions from Kuwait, Qatar, Oman and many other countries that horribly abuse women and LGBT citizens.[33] To cover-up her corrupt dealings, Hillary Clinton illegally stashed her State Department emails on a private server.  Her server was easily hacked by foreign governments – perhaps even by her financial backers in Communist China – putting all of America in danger.[34]  Then there are the 33,000 emails she deleted.[35]  While we may not know what is in those deleted emails, our enemies probably do.  So they probably now have a blackmail file over someone who wants to be President of the United States.  This fact alone disqualifies her from the Presidency.  We can\\'t hand over our government to someone whose deepest, darkest secrets may be in the hands of our enemies.  National security is also immigration security – and Hillary wants neither.  Hillary Clinton has put forward the most radical immigration platform in the history of the United States.  She has pledged to grant mass amnesty and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement, and thus create totally open borders in the United States.[36]  The first victims of her radical policies will be poor African-American and Hispanic workers who need jobs. They are the ones she will hurt the most.  Let me share with you a letter our campaign received from Mary Ann Mendoza.  She lost her amazing son, Police Sergeant Brandon Mendoza, after he was killed by an illegal immigrant because of the open borders policies supported by Hillary Clinton.[37]  Sadly, the Mendoza family is just one of thousands who have suffered the same fate.  Here is an excerpt from Mrs. Mendoza\\'s letter:  \"Hillary Clinton, who already has the blood of so many on her hands, is now announcing that she is willing to put each and every one of our lives in harms\\' way – an open door policy to criminals and terrorists to enter our country. Hillary is not concerned about you or I, she is only concerned about the power the presidency would bring to her. She needs to go to prison to pay for the crimes she has already committed against this country.\"  Hillary also wants to spend hundreds of billions to resettle Middle Eastern refugees in the United States, on top of the current record level of immigration.  For the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America.  Hillary\\'s Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor, and unemployed Americans out of work. She can\\'t claim to care about African-American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.  Here are a few things a Trump Administration will do for America in the first 100 days:  Appoint judges who will uphold the Constitution. Hillary Clinton\\'s radical judges will virtually abolish the 2nd amendment. Change immigration rules to give unemployed Americans an opportunity to fill good-paying jobs Stand up to countries that cheat on trade, of which there are many Cancel rules and regulations that send jobs overseas Lift restrictions on energy production Repeal and replace job-killing Obamacare -- it is a disaster. Pass massive tax reform to create millions of new jobs. Impose tough new ethics rules to restore dignity to the Office of Secretary of State. There is one common theme in all of these reforms.  It\\'s going to be America First.  This is why the stakes in November are so great.  On Election Day, the politicians stand trial before the people.  The voters are the jury. Their ballots are the verdict. We don\\'t need or want another Clinton or Obama.  Come November, the American people will have a chance to issue a verdict on the politicians that have sacrificed their security, betrayed their prosperity, and sold out their country.  They will have a chance to vote for a new agenda with big dreams, bold ideas and enormous possibilities for the American people.  Hillary Clinton\\'s message is old and tired. Her message is that can\\'t change.  My message is that things have to change – and this is our one chance do it. This is our last chance to do it.  Americans are the people that tamed the West, that dug out the Panama Canal, that sent satellites across the solar system that built the great dams, and so much more.  Then we started thinking small.  We stopped believing in what America could do, and became reliant on other countries, other people, and other institutions.  We lost our sense of purpose, and daring.  But that\\'s not who we are.  Come this November, we can bring America back – bigger and better, and stronger than ever.  We will build the greatest infrastructure on the planet earth – the roads and railways and airports of tomorrow.  Our military will have the best technology and finest equipment – we will bring it back all the way.  Massive new factories will come roaring into our country – breathing life and hope into our communities.  Inner cities, which have been horribly abused by Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party, will finally be rebuilt.  Construction is what I know -- nobody knows it better.  The real wages for our workers have not been raised for 18 years -- but these wages will start going up, along with the new jobs. Hillary\\'s massive taxation, regulation and open borders will destroy jobs and drive down wages for everyone.  We are also going to be supporting our police and law enforcement -- we can never forget the great job they do.  I am also going to appoint great Supreme Court Justices.  Our country is going to start working again.  People are going to start working again.  Parents are going to start dreaming big for their children again – including parents in our inner cities.  Americans are going to start believing in the future or our country.  We are going to make America rich again.  We are going to make America safe again.  We are going to make America Great Again – and Great Again For EVERYONE.  ------------------------------------------------------  [1] (\"Sen.

Instead they have become part of the rigged system in Washington, D.C. that benefits only the insiders.  I believe their members will be voting for me in much larger numbers than for her.  Hillary Clinton and her husband have made hundreds of millions of dollars doing favors and selling access to Wall Street, special interests and oppressive foreign regimes. As Bernie Sanders said, \"Why, over her political career, has Wall Street been the major campaign contributor to Hillary Clinton?\" They own Hillary Clinton and she will do whatever they tell her to.  Bernie Sanders is also 100% correct when he says that Hillary Clinton \"vote[d] for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs.\" Hillary supported NAFTA and she supported the trade deal with China, Vietnam, South Korea – and if elected will implement the TPP she loves so much – guaranteed.  While Secretary of State,\\'Hillary Clinton racked up a $1 trillion trade deficit with China – all while China was funneling a small fortune to Hillary via speaking fees paid to Bill.  On immigration, Hillary Clinton sides with Wall Street too. Bernie Sanders correctly warned that open borders \"would substantially lower wages in this country,\" and yet Hillary has put forward a plan that would completely open America\\'s borders in her first 100 days in office.  On energy, Hillary Clinton wants to shut down the coal mines, block the Keystone pipeline, and destroy millions of good union jobs through executive action.  Her massive proposed increase in taxes and regulations will also send millions of jobs overseas.  Hillary Clinton will economically destroy poor communities, African-American and Hispanic workers on trade, immigration, crime, energy, taxes, regulation and everything else.  Finally, union workers have long believed in having an open and free society. Yet Hillary takes money from regimes that support the murder of gays and the enslavement of women while pushing to bring people into America who want to do the exact same thing to our people. I only want to bring people into our country who will love and support everyone.  Hillary Clinton is the enemy of working people and is the best friend Wall Street ever had. I will fight harder for American workers than anyone ever has, and I will fight for their right to elect leaders who will do the same. I will be a president for ALL Americans.', 'link_name': '', 'status_type': 'status', 'status_link': '', 'status_published': '6/16/2016 15:30:53', 'num_reactions': '54582', 'num_comments': '5193', 'num_shares': '11962', 'num_likes': '49598', 'num_loves': '2073', 'num_wows': '229', 'num_hahas': '118', 'num_sads': '188', 'num_angrys': '2376'}, {'status_id': '153080620724_10157174187700725', 'status_message': \"GOOD MORNING AMERICA! Wow!  A year ago, today, many of you joined me at Trump Tower in calling for real change in Washington, D.C. I am proud to say that with your support we are well on our way to Making America Great Again!  Since the moment I rode down the escalator on June 16th, 2015, and decided to run for President, my campaign has been filled with nothing but excitement, dedication, and passion to change our country for the better – this is only the beginning of our movement.  I am honored and proud to lead our fight to put America first. This past year, I have travelled this great country and met many incredible Americans at our rallies. Yesterday in Atlanta, Georgia- we had a packed house of loving supporters. Even early on in our campaign, we had a record-setting rally in Mobile, Alabama, with over 30,000 attendees that joined our movement to Make America Great Again.  The Republican primary began with 17 experienced and talented candidates for President. At the Ronald Reagan Library on September 16th, your overwhelming support showed that our campaign had the message that resonated with hard- working Americans, and that DC-centric way of thinking is no longer capable of leading our country.  My campaign has been one of honesty and substance. We have created much-needed dialogue around the important issues facing our country. You've seen my leadership in setting the agenda this whole political season, on both sides of the aisle. We wouldn't be talking about illegal immigration. We wouldn't be talking about the drugs pouring in and the bad trade deals costing American jobs. We wouldn't have called the terrorist attack in Orlando for what it is: radical Islamic terrorism. Politicians are all talk and no action.   The support of many wonderful Americans, led to resounding victories in the Republican Primary race, in which we beat the rigged political system and biased media with landslide victories. Our success began on February 9th, with an emphatic win in New Hampshire and reached a high point with our victory in South Carolina on February 20th. We had some tough losses along the way, but with your support we were able to bounce back and sweep the Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island on April 26th, along with other monumental wins throughout the primary season. The best of which was our win in Indiana on May 3rd, which led to us being declared the presumptive nominee and make history!  The strong vote of confidence that American voters have placed in our message of Making America Great Again, has buoyed us to many victories and is truly heartwarming. While we are thankful for the phenomenal success we have enjoyed in the past year, we are just beginning! I could not be more thrilled as your presumptive Republican Presidential Nominee and to officially accept the GOP Nomination at the Convention in July. We must continue to strive towards beating Crooked Hillary in November and Making ALL of America Great Again!  Thank you again for your support.  Best Wishes,   Donald J.

Senator Cruz has done very poorly and after his New York performance, which was a total disaster, he is in free fall and as everyone has seen, he does not react well under pressure. Also, approximately 80% of the Republican Party is against him. Governor Kasich, who has only won 1 state out of 41, in other words, he is 1 for 41 and he is not even doing as well as other candidates who could have stubbornly stayed in the race like him but chose not to do so. Marco Rubio, as an example, has more delegates than Kasich and yet suspended his campaign one month ago. Others, likewise, have done much better than Kasich, who would get slaughtered by Hillary Clinton once the negative ads against him begin. 85% of Republican voters are against Kasich.  Collusion is often illegal in many other industries and yet these two Washington insiders have had to revert to collusion in order to stay alive. They are mathematically dead and this act only shows, as puppets of donors and special interests, how truly weak they and their campaigns are. I have brought millions of voters into the Republican primary system and have received many millions of votes more than Cruz or Kasich. Additionally, I am far ahead of both candidates with delegates and would be receiving in excess of 60% of the vote except for the fact that there were so many candidates running against me.  Because of me, everyone now sees that the Republican primary system is totally rigged. When two candidates who have no path to victory get together to stop a candidate who is expanding the party by millions of voters, (all of whom will drop out if I am not in the race) it is yet another example of everything that is wrong in Washington and our political system.

Trump announced that Paul J. Manafort will serve as his campaign\\'s Convention Manager. Mr. Manafort is volunteering his considerable insight and expertise because of his belief that Mr. Trump is the right person for these difficult times. He will be responsible for transitioning the Trump campaign\\'s activities as they relate to Mr. Trump\\'s nomination at the convention in Cleveland, Ohio.  Mr. Manafort\\'s experience spans over three decades of working on U.S. presidential campaigns, and includes work on conventions for Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and George H.W. Bush, as well as Republican Presidential nominee, Bob Dole. Mr. Trump will use Mr. Manafort\\'s years of experience to support his efforts in all aspects of the convention as he closes in on the Republican nomination for President.  Currently, Mr. Manafort is an attorney and founding partner of DMP International, LLC where he has been active in business and international affairs for the last 20 years. Previously, he was a partner at BMS&K for 15 years and worked on dozens of international political campaigns in an effort to bring democratic expertise to foreign countries. He served as a director of OPIC following his appointment by President Reagan, and was on the Investment Policy Advisory Committee at the Office of the US Trade Representative.  Mr. Trump stated, \"Paul is a great asset and an important addition as we consolidate the tremendous support we have received in the primaries and caucuses, garnering millions more votes than any other candidate. Paul Manafort, and the team I am building, bring the needed skill sets to ensure that the will of the Republican voters, not the Washington political establishment, determines who will be the nominee for the Republican Party. I look forward to winning the nomination, and ultimately the presidency in order to Make America Great Again.\"  On his appointment Mr. Manafort said, \"I am honored to serve Mr. Trump\\'s campaign, and look forward to helping secure his nomination as the Republican nominee for President. Mr. Trump has tapped into the growing disillusionment with the Washington political establishment. What he has achieved so far is historic. My role is to work with the professionals that Mr. Trump has assembled to protect the victories that he has won in states across the country. I am confident that he will be the Republican nominee and the next President of the United States.\"  In addition, Mr. Trump is announcing that his campaign is opening a Washington, DC based office to coordinate his campaign\\'s work with the Republican National Committee, Congress, and his convention and delegate operations.
