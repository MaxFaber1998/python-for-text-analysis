      "Er zijn momenten dat ik me behoorlijk schaam om Europeaan te zijn. In het afgelopen jaar zijn meer dan een miljoen mensen naar Europa gekomen op zoek naar hulp en tot nu toe is onze reactie erbarmelijk. Er zijn zoveel tegenstrijdigheden. We rouwen om de tragische dood van de tweejarige Alan Kurdi, en toch zijn er sindsdien al meer dan 200 kinderen verdronken in de Middellandse Zee. In internationale verdragen staat dat we de verantwoordelijkheid voor vluchtelingen delen, maar we accepteren dat het piepkleine Libanon meer Syriërs ontvangt dan heel Europa bij elkaar. We betreuren het bestaan van mensensmokkelaars, maar we maken er de enige haalbare manier van om asiel te zoeken in Europa. Er zijn tekorten op onze arbeidsmarkt, maar mensen die aan onze economische en demografische behoeften voldoen, laten we niet naar Europa komen. We verkondigen onze liberale waarden tegenover de fundamentalistische islam, en toch -- hebben we een repressief beleid dat asielzoekende kinderen gevangenzet, dat kinderen van hun ouders scheidt en dat vluchtelingen hun bezit afneemt. Wat zijn we aan het doen? Hoe is het zover gekomen, dat we zo inhumaan reageren op een humanitaire crisis? Niet omdat het mensen niets kan schelen. Dat wil ik in ieder geval niet geloven. Ik geloof dat het onze politici ontbreekt aan een visie om het internationale vluchtelingensysteem dat 50 jaar oud is, aan te passen aan een veranderende, geglobaliseerde wereld. Nu wil ik een stapje terug zetten en twee fundamentele vragen stellen, de twee dingen die we ons allemaal moeten afvragen. Ten eerste: waarom werkt het huidige systeem niet? En ten tweede: hoe kunnen we het beter maken? Het moderne vluchtelingenregime is na de Tweede Wereldoorlog ingesteld door deze mannen. Het voornaamste doel is ervoor zorgen dat als het niet goed gaat in een staat, of een staat zich tegen zijn volk keert, mensen ergens naartoe kunnen, ergens veilig en waardig kunnen wonen tot ze weer naar huis kunnen. Het is gemaakt voor situaties precies zoals wat we nu in Syrië zien. Met een internationaal verdrag ondertekend door 147 regeringen, het Verdrag betreffende de status van vluchtelingen uit 1951, en een internationale organisatie, UNHCR, beloofden de staten elkaars inwoners toegang te verlenen tot hun grondgebied als ze zouden vluchten voor conflict en vervolging. Maar nu schiet dat systeem tekort. In theorie hebben vluchtelingen het recht om asiel aan te vragen. Maar ons immigratiebeleid blokkeert het pad naar de veiligheid. In theorie hebben vluchtelingen het recht op een kans om te integreren of om terug te gaan naar hun eigen land. In de praktijk komen ze vast te zitten in een bijna oneindig limbo. In theorie draagt de hele wereld deze verantwoordelijkheid. In de praktijk zijn het de landen in de buurt van het conflict die de overgrote meerderheid van de vluchtelingen opnemen. Het systeem is niet kapot omdat de regels verkeerd zijn. Wij passen ze niet goed toe op een veranderende wereld, en daar moeten we over nadenken. Ik ga nu kort uitleggen hoe het huidige systeem werkt. Hoe werkt het vluchtelingenregime precies? Niet vanuit een top-down perspectief, maar vanuit het perspectief van een vluchteling. Stel je een Syrische vrouw voor. We noemen haar Amira. Voor mij vertegenwoordigt Amira veel van de mensen die ik daar heb ontmoet. Amira is, net als zo'n 25 procent van de vluchtelingen in de wereld, een vrouw met kinderen, en ze kan niet naar huis want ze komt uit de stad die je hier ziet, Homs, ooit een prachtige historische stad, die nu in puin ligt. Dus Amira kan niet terug daarnaartoe. Maar Amira heeft ook geen hoop om zich te vestigen in een derde land, want dat lot is weggelegd voor minder dan een procent van de vluchtelingen in de wereld. Amira en haar gezin staan voor een bijna onmogelijke keuze. Ze hebben drie opties. De eerste is dat Amira en haar gezin naar een kamp gaan. In het kamp krijgt ze misschien hulp, maar er zijn daar weinig kansen voor Amira en haar gezin. Kampen liggen op troosteloze, dorre plaatsen, vaak in de woestijn. In het vluchtelingenkamp Zaatari in Jordanië hoor je 's nachts de granaten over de grens in Syrië. De economische activiteit is er beperkt. Het onderwijs is vaak van slechte kwaliteit. En over de hele wereld moet ongeveer 80 procent van de vluchtelingen in kampen daar minstens vijf jaar blijven. Het is een armzalig bestaan, en waarschijnlijk is dat de reden dat slechts 9 procent van de Syriërs voor die optie kiest. In plaats daarvan kan Amira naar een stedelijk gebied gaan in een buurland, zoals Amman of Beiroet. Die optie heeft ongeveer 75 procent van de Syrische vluchtelingen gekozen. Maar ook dat stelt grote problemen. Vluchtelingen in zulke gebieden hebben vaak niet het recht om te werken. Ze krijgen vaak nauwelijks toegang tot bijstand. Dus als Amira en haar gezin geen geld meer hebben, zullen ze waarschijnlijk in extreme armoede leven. Er is een derde optie, waar steeds meer Syriërs voor kiezen. Amira kan hoop voor haar familie zoeken door hun levens op het spel te zetten tijdens een gevaarlijke reis naar een ander land, en dat zien we nu in Europa. Over de hele wereld moeten vluchtelingen een bijna onmogelijke keuze maken tussen drie opties: kampen, stedelijke armoede of gevaarlijke reizen. Voor vluchtelingen is dat de keuze die het huidige vluchtelingenregime biedt. Ik vind het een onjuiste keuze. We moeten die keuze herzien. De reden dat we die opties beperken is dat we denken dat vluchtelingen geen andere opties hebben. Dat is niet waar. Politici presenteren dit als een nulsomkwestie, alsof vluchtelingen helpen kosten oplevert voor de inwoners. We hebben de neiging om aan te nemen dat vluchtelingen hoe dan ook een kostenpost of belasting voor de samenleving zijn. Maar ze kunnen ook bijdragen. Ik wil laten zien dat er manieren zijn om meer keuzes te bieden waar iedereen profijt van heeft: de ontvangende landen en gemeenschappen, onze samenlevingen en de vluchtelingen zelf. En ik wil vier manieren voorstellen die kunnen veranderen hoe we over vluchtelingen denken. De vier manieren hebben iets gemeen: ze maken allemaal gebruik van de kansen van globalisering, mobiliteit en markten, en ze moderniseren onze blik op het vluchtelingenprobleem. Waar ik als eerste aan wil denken, zijn omgevingen die mogelijkheden bieden. Daarvoor moeten we allereerst inzien dat vluchtelingen mensen zijn zoals ieder ander, maar dan in een uitzonderlijke situatie. Samen met mijn collega's in Oxford hebben we in Oeganda onderzoek gedaan naar het economische leven van vluchtelingen. Oeganda is niet representatief voor alle ontvangende landen. Het is een uitzondering. In tegenstelling tot de meeste gastlanden, heeft Oeganda vluchtelingen economische kansen gegeven. Ze hebben daar het recht om te werken. Ze hebben vrijheid van beweging. De gevolgen daarvan zijn buitengewoon, voor zowel de vluchtelingen als de gemeenschap zelf. We ontdekten dat in de hoofdstad, Kampala, 21 procent van de vluchtelingen een bedrijf met werknemers heeft, en 40 procent van die werknemers komen uit het ontvangende land. Vluchtelingen zorgen dus voor banen voor inwoners van het ontvangende land. Zelfs in de kampen vonden we uitzonderlijke voorbeelden van bloeiende ondernemingen. In het plaatsje Nakivale vonden we bijvoorbeeld voorbeelden van Congolese vluchtelingen met digitale muziekbedrijfjes. We vonden een Rwandees met een onderneming die jongeren computerspellen laat spelen op gerecycleerde spelcomputers en gerecycleerde tv's. Ondanks de extreme beperkingen die vluchtelingen hebben zijn ze aan het innoveren. Deze man is een Congolees genaamd Demou-Kay. Toen hij aankwam, had Demou-Kay heel weinig, maar hij wilde filmmaker worden. Dus samen met vrienden en collega's begon hij een radiostation, hij huurde een videocamera en nu maakt hij films. Hij heeft twee documentaires gemaakt, met en voor ons team, en een succesvol bedrijf opgebouwd met heel weinig middelen. Zulke voorbeelden zouden onze reactie op vluchtelingen moeten leiden. In plaats van ze te zien als onvermijdelijk afhankelijk van humanitaire hulp, moeten we ze kansen bieden om te gedijen als mens. Ja, kleding, dekens, onderdak en voedsel zijn allemaal belangrijk tijdens de noodfase, maar we moeten ook verder kijken. We moeten mogelijkheden bieden voor connectiviteit, elektriciteit, onderwijs, het recht om te werken, toegang tot kapitaal en banken. Alle vanzelfsprekende middelen die ons verbinden met de wereldeconomie kunnen en moeten ook gelden voor vluchtelingen. Het tweede idee dat ik wil bespreken, zijn economische zones. Helaas kiest niet ieder land in de wereld dezelfde benadering als Oeganda. De meeste gastlanden stellen hun economie niet open voor vluchtelingen zoals zij dat doen. Maar er zijn praktische alternatieven die we kunnen gebruiken. In april was ik in Jordanië met een collega, ontwikkelingseconoom Paul Collier. We hebben gebrainstormd met de overheid en de internationale gemeenschap, over een idee om Syriërs banen te bieden en ook de nationale ontwikkelingsstrategie van Jordanië te steunen. Het idee is een economische zone, waarin we vluchtelingen werk zouden kunnen bieden naast inwoners van het gastland Jordanië. Op slechts 15 minuten van het vluchtelingenkamp Zaatari, met 83.000 vluchtelingen, ligt al een economische zone de King Hussein Bin Talal Development Area. Het heeft de regering meer dan 100 miljoen dollar gekost om het gebied aan te sluiten op het hoogspanningsnetwerk en het wegennet, maar er ontbraken twee dingen: toegang tot werk en binnenwaartse investering. Wat als vluchtelingen daar konden werken, en niet vastzaten in kampen, en hun gezinnen konden onderhouden en beroepsvaardigheden konden leren voor ze teruggaan naar Syrië? We zagen in dat dat goed zou zijn voor Jordanië dat volgens de ontwikkelingsstrategie de overstap moet maken naar productie, als middeninkomensland. Dit kan vluchtelingen helpen, maar het kan ook bijdragen tot de wederopbouw van Syrië omdat we vluchtelingen moeten steunen in hun ontwikkeling als de beste bron voor de uiteindelijke wederopbouw van Syrië. We hebben hierover geschreven in het tijdschrift Foreign Affairs. Koning Abdullah heeft het idee opgepikt. Het werd twee weken geleden op een conferentie aangekondigd en de pilootfase begint in de zomer. (Applaus) Het derde idee dat ik jullie wil voorleggen, is het afstemmen van voorkeuren tussen landen en vluchtelingen voor gelukkige resultaten zoals je in deze selfie ziet, met Angela Merkel en een Syrische vluchteling. We vragen vluchtelingen zelden wat zij willen, waar zij naartoe willen, maar ik denk dat we dat kunnen doen en dat iedereen dan beter af is. Econoom Alvin Roth heeft een methode ontwikkeld voor het matchen van markten, manieren waarop de voorkeur van de partijen leidt tot een uiteindelijke match. Mijn collega's Will Jones en Alex Teytelboym hebben onderzocht hoe dat idee kan worden toegepast op vluchtelingen: vluchtelingen vragen naar hun voorkeur wat betreft bestemmingen, maar ook de landen vragen wat voor vluchtelingen ze willen qua vaardigheden of taalbeheersing, en die bij elkaar zoeken. Natuurlijk moet je er quota in verwerken voor bijvoorbeeld diversiteit en kwetsbaarheid, maar het is een manier om de kans op een match te vergroten. Dit idee is al succesvol ingezet voor bijvoorbeeld het matchen van studenten en universiteiten, of nierdonoren en patiënten, en het ligt ook ten grondslag aan de algoritmen van datingwebsites. Waarom gebruiken we het niet om vluchtelingen meer keus te geven? Het kan ook worden ingezet op nationaal niveau. Een van onze grootste uitdagingen is om plaatselijke gemeenschappen te overtuigen vluchtelingen toe te laten. Momenteel gebeurt het in mijn land bijvoorbeeld dat ingenieurs naar het platteland gaan en boeren naar de steden, wat echt nergens op slaat. Markten matchen biedt een mogelijkheid om die voorkeuren samen te brengen en te luisteren naar de behoeften en eisen van de gastgemeenschappen en van de vluchtelingen zelf. Het vierde idee gaat over humanitaire visums. Veel van de tragiek en chaos in Europa had volledig voorkomen kunnen worden. Het komt voort uit een fundamentele tegenstelling in het Europese asielbeleid, namelijk: om asiel te zoeken in Europa, moet je spontaan aankomen door een gevaarlijke reis te ondernemen, zoals ik heb beschreven. Maar waarom zouden die reizen nodig zijn in een tijd van budgetvluchten en moderne diplomatieke mogelijkheden? Het zijn compleet overbodige reizen, en vorig jaar resulteerden ze in de dood van meer dan 3000 mensen, aan de grenzen van Europa en op Europees grondgebied. Als ze gewoon toestemming kregen om direct te reizen en asiel te zoeken in Europa, zouden we dat voorkomen, en dat is mogelijk door middel van een humanitair visum dat mensen kunnen ophalen bij een ambassade of een consulaat in een buurland, waarbij ze gewoon betalen voor een boottocht of een vlucht naar Europa. Het kost ongeveer duizend euro om met een smokkelaar van Turkije naar de Griekse eilanden te gaan. Voor 200 euro kun je met het vliegtuig van Bodrum naar Frankfurt. Als we vluchtelingen die optie gaven, zou dat grote voordelen opleveren. Het zou levens redden, het zou de hele markt voor smokkelaars ondermijnen en het zou de chaos beëindigen aan de Europese grenzen, in gebieden zoals de Griekse eilanden. Het is de politiek die ons tegenhoudt, eerder dan een rationele oplossing. En dit idee is al toegepast. Brazilië maakt gebruik van een vernieuwende benadering waardoor 2000 Syriërs humanitaire visums hebben gekregen, Brazilië zijn binnengekomen en bij aankomst de vluchtelingenstatus hebben kunnen krijgen. Elke Syriër die door dat systeem is gegaan, heeft de vluchtelingenstatus gekregen en is erkend als echte vluchteling. Er bestaat ook een historisch precedent. Tussen 1922 en 1942 is het Nansenpaspoort gebruikt als reisdocument om 450.000 Assyriërs, Turken en Tsjetsjenen door Europa te laten reizen om elders in Europa de vluchtelingenstatus te claimen. De internationale organisatie voor vluchtelingen heeft de Nobelprijs gekregen als waardering voor de uitvoerbaarheid van deze strategie. Deze vier ideeën die ik aan jullie heb gepresenteerd, zijn manieren waarop we Amira meer keuzes kunnen bieden. Het zijn manieren die vluchtelingen meer mogelijkheden te bieden dan die drie onmogelijke opties die ik heb uitgelegd, en waardoor ook anderen beter af zijn. Kortom: we hebben echt een nieuwe visie nodig, een visie die vluchtelingen meer keuzes geeft, met het inzicht dat ze geen last hoeven te zijn. Vluchtelingen hoeven geen kostenpost te zijn. Ja, ze zijn een humanitaire verantwoordelijkheid, maar het zijn mensen met vaardigheden, talenten en ambities, die in staat zijn bij te dragen -- als we dat toestaan. In de nieuwe wereld zal migratie niet verdwijnen. Wat we in Europa hebben gezien, zal nog vele jaren duren. Mensen zullen blijven reizen, uit hun land worden verjaagd. We moeten rationele, realistische manieren vinden om hiermee om te gaan -- niet op basis van de oude logica van humanitaire hulp, niet op basis van liefdadigheid, maar op basis van de kansen van globalisering, markten en mobiliteit. Ik verzoek jullie dringend onze politici aan te manen om deze uitdaging het hoofd te bieden. Dankuwel. (Applaus)\n"
